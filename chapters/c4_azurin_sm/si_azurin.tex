%==================BULK Switching=========================
\paragraph*{Fluorescence switching in bulk.} Fluorescence measurements in bulk of different peaks of azurin-ATTO655 sample (Figure S\ref{SIfig: peak_sep}) were carried out to determine the FRET switching ratio.
The measurements were done in Cary Eclipse Spectrometer (Varian Inc. Agilent Technology, USA).
A \SI{50}{\nM} sample was excited with \SI{665}{\nm} and intensity was monitored above \SI{675}{\nm}.
Sodium ascorbate (reductant) and pottasium ferricyanide (oxidant) were added alternatively.
Among all the labeled position, peak-III showed maximum switching ratio and it's intensity change can be seen in Figure S\ref{SIfig: switching}.
Similarly Zn Azurin-ATTO655 showed little or no change in intensity.

  The emission spectrum of ATTO655 (red) has a good overlap with the absorption of Cu(II)azurin to show high FRET. 
  (b) Fluorescence intensity of \SI{50}{\nM} CuAzurin-ATTO655 shows high intensity in the presence of reductant and low 
  intensity with oxidant.
  The switching ratio comes to be \SI{90}{\percent} satisfying the requirement for single-molecule FRET.}

  \caption{Time traces of Zn Azurin (left) and of Cu Azurin(right) labeled with ATTO655 at different potential. 
  Above \SI{40}{\mV}, Cu-Azurin show swiching in the intensity due to changes in the oxidation state of the Copper metal center and below \SI{40}{\mV}, triplet blinking contributes to the switching as can be seen in the redox inactive Zn-Azurin.
  To keep the analysis simple, time traces above \SI{40}{\mV} were choosen for Cu azurin}

  \caption{Single-molecule azurin switching and lifetime. (a) Time trace of a single Cu azurin at \SI{50}{\mV} with a binning time of \SI{50}{\ms}.
  Notice the three different labels indicated in the figure. Bright (Cu(I)) state as above the red line, oxidized state is between red and black and Dark counts are below the black line. The fact that the molecule doesn't go to the dark count label before being bleached shows that the transitions are due to Copper oxidation switching rather than triplet blinking of the dye.
  Once the fluorophore is bleached, no transitions were observavable.
  (b) The lifetime histogram corresponding to bright state (red), oxidized state (blue) and instrument response function (black).
  The lifetime of oxidized state is much shorter than the reduced state due to FRET quenching.}

  \caption{Autocorrelation of time traces of Cuazurin-ATTO655 (a) and Znazurin-ATTO655 at different potential. 
  At lower potential, Cuazurin-ATTO655 has longer correlation time (on time) which shows that the molecule spends more time on the Cu(I) state.
  But below \SI{50}{\mV} the dye (ATTO655) starts to show triplet blinking.
  As potential is lowered the triplet blinking dominates.
  The Cu azurin study is focussed in the safe window of potential more than \SI{40}{\mV} where triplet blinking is absent.}
