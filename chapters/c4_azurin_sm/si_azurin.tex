%==================BULK Switching=========================
\paragraph*{Fluorescence switching in bulk.} Fluorescence measurements in bulk of different peaks of azurin-ATTO655 sample (Figure S\ref{SIfig: peak_sep}) related to different positions of the dye on the protein surface were carried out to determine the FRET switching ratio.
The measurements were done in Cary Eclipse Spectrometer (Varian Inc. Agilent Technology, USA).
A \SI{50}{\nM} sample was excited with \SI{665}{\nm} and intensity was monitored above \SI{675}{\nm}.
Sodium ascorbate (reductant) and pottasium ferricyanide (oxidant) were added alternatively.
Among all the labeled positions, peak-III showed maximum switching ratio and its intensity change can be seen in Figure S\ref{SIfig: switching}.
Similarly Zn Azurin-ATTO655 showed little or no change in intensity.

  The emission spectrum of ATTO655 (red) has a good overlap with the absorption of Cu(II)azurin to show high FRET. 
  (b) Fluorescence intensity of \SI{50}{\nM} CuAzurin-ATTO655 shows high intensity in the presence of reductant and low 
  intensity with oxidant.
  The switching ratio is \SI{90}{\percent} which satisfies the requirement for single-molecule FRET.

  Above \SI{40}{\mV}, Cu-Azurin shows switching in the intensity due to changes in the oxidation state of the copper metal center and below \SI{40}{\mV}, triplet blinking contributes to the switching as can be seen in the redox inactive Zn-Azurin.
  To keep the analysis simple, time traces above \SI{40}{\mV} were choosen for Cu azurin.

  \caption{\textbf{Single-molecule azurin switching and lifetime.} (a) Time trace of a single Cu azurin at \SI{50}{\mV} with a binning time of \SI{50}{\ms}.
  Notice the three different labels indicated in the figure.
  Bright (Cu(I)) state as above the red line, oxidized state is between red and black and Dark counts are below the black line.
  The fact that the molecule does not go to the dark count label before being bleached shows that the transitions are due to copper oxidation switching rather than triplet blinking of the dye.
  Once the fluorophore is bleached, transitions were no longer observable.
  (b) The lifetime histogram corresponding to bright state (red), oxidized state (blue) and instrument response function (black).
  The lifetime of the oxidized state is much shorter than that of the reduced state due to FRET quenching.}

  At lower potential, Cu azurin-ATTO655 has longer correlation time (on time), which shows that the molecule spends more time on the Cu(I) state.
  But below \SI{50}{\mV} the dye (ATTO655) starts to show triplet blinking.
  As the potential is lowered the triplet blinking dominates.
  The Cu azurin study is focused in the safe window of potential more than \SI{40}{\mV} where triplet blinking is absent.}

% =============== Dynamic heterogenity ==================
\clearpage
\paragraph*{Examples of dynamic heterogeneity in different molecules}
Different azurin molecules show different dynamic patterns of dynamic heterogeneity.
As the number of conformations azurin can possess is large, we could not obtain reliable histogram of the times the protein takes to convert from one conformation to another.
Figure S\ref{SIfig:dynamic_trace_steps}, S\ref{SIfig:dynamic_Point_20_75mV_S105}, S\ref{SIfig:dynamic_Point_21_75mV_S105} show three different azurin molecules with very different dynamics.
Correlation of bright and dark times of  different molecules are shown in Figure S\ref{SIfig:Dynamic_corr_many}.

  Along with variation at shorter time scales (tens of seconds), the molecule shows a major step like change.
  The distribution of mid-point potential shows two peaks with values at around \SI{20}{\mV} and \SI{-20}{\mV}.
