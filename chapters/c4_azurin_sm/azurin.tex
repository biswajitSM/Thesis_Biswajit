\section{Experimental Section}

\paragraph*{Protein synthesis.}
Azurin (wild type) from \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} was expressed in \textit{E. Coli} and purified as described before \citep{kamp1990purification}.
BL21 \textit{E.coli} cells were transformed with PGK22 plasmid that carries the gene for azurin.
The cells were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium.
Then the cells were harvested and resuspended in a \SI{20}{\percent} (w/v) sucrose solution in Tris pH 8 buffer containing \SI{1}{\mM} EDTA.
The solution was centrifuged (\SI{8000}{ rpm}, \SI{20}{\minute}) and the supernatant was collected.
Copper sulfate was added to the solution for insertion into the active site of azurin.
The unwanted proteins were precipitated by addition of concentrated acetic acid until pH 4. 
The turbid solution was centrifuged at \SI{8000}{ rpm} for \SI{20}{\minute}.
The supernatant was loaded on a CM Sepharose fast flow column and elution was performed in an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare) with a pH gradient from 4 to 6.9 in 
\SI{50}{\mM} ammonium acetate.
Fractions containing azurin (inferred from the absorbance at \SI{290}{\nm} and \SI{620}{\nm}) were collected and reduced with sodium dithionite.
At this moment the solution contained both zinc and copper azurin.
The azurins were purified in a DEAE sepharose column by a salt gradient of 0 to \SI{50}{\mM} NaCl in Tris pH8 buffer. 
Fractions containing copper azurin and zinc azurin were collected and concentrated separately.
The purity of the samples was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and UV/Vis spectroscopy (Cary 50 spectrophotometer, Varian Inc., Agilent Technologies, USA).
The azurins appeared on SDS gel page at $\sim$\SI{14}{ kDa}.
Both zinc and copper azurin showed a characteristic shoulder at ${\sim}$\SI{290}{\nm} while Cu azurin showed an additional 
broad absorption peak at \SI{620}{\nm} when oxidized as can be seen in Figure-S\ref{SIfig: switching}. 
The ratio $O.D_{\SI{628}{\nm}}/O.D_{\SI{280}{\nm}}$ for Cu azurin was 0.56 which indicated that all the azurin molecules had a Cu atom. 
The concentrated protein was stored at \SI{80}{\celsius} until further use.

\paragraph*{Fluorescent labeling.}
The labeling protocol was based on previous work \cite{nicolardi2012topdown}.
ATTO655 NHS-ester was bought from ATTO-TEC GmbH and used without further putification.
The azurin solution was equillibrated with HEPES pH 8.3 for higher efficiency of amine-NHSester reaction.
ATTO655 was chosen to label the protein because of its photostability and inertness (unreactive) to the redox chemicals used in the study.
A mixture of \SI{200}{\uM} azurin and ATTO 655 NHS-ester (1:1) was incubated for \SI{45}{\minute}.
The NHS-ester group reacts with one of the amine groups on the protein.
The unreacted dyes were removed with a HiTrap desalting column.
The labeled protein was concentrated in Tris pH 8.5 buffer by centrifuging in a \SI{3}{ kDa} Amicon ultra filter.
The labeled protein was further purified by an ion exchange chromatography in a \SI{1}{\ml} MonoQ column (GE Health).
The different peaks obtained (see Figure S\ref{SIfig: peak_sep}) correspond to different numbers and positions of the dye on the azurin surface. 
The peak-III corresponds to the protein labeled at Lysine122 position \cite{nicolardi2012topdown}.
For this position of the dye, the protein construct shows a high fluorescence switching \SI{90}{\percent} ratio between oxidized and reduced condition as can be seen in Figure S\ref{SIfig: peak_sep}. This fraction was chosen for our single-molecule experiment as the two states can be observed easily.
The same protocol was used for Zn azurin labeling and similar peak separations were observed.
The fluorescently labeled proteins were then reacted with biotin-PEG-NHS (MW 3400) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 buffer with a ratio 1:5 to make sure each protein has at least one biotin.
The free biotin was then removed by centrifuging in a \SI{3}{ kDa} Amicon ultra filter.
The biotin on the protein will be used for immobilization on the glass surface.

\paragraph*{Functionalization of cover slips.}
The functionalization of glass surface was achieved according to previous work with a little modification.\cite{gupta2012involvement}
Glass coverslips (Menzel-Glaser, $\SI{22}{\mm} \times \SI{40}{\mm}$, no. 1 thickness) were used for immobilization.
The cover slips were sonicated in water (\SI{15}{\minute}) and acetone (\SI{15}{\minute}).
Then they were rinsed in Milli-Q water several times and incubated in a \ce{H2O}/\ce{NH4OH}/\ce(H2O2)(5:1:1) bath at \SI{70}{\celsius} for removing organic impurities on the surface.
The coverslips were rinsed several times with water and ethanol and finally stored in ethanol.
Before functionalization, the slides were flamed and treated for \SI{30}{\minute} with a \SI{1}{\percent} solution of [3-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyl]trimethoxysilane in methanol containing \SI{5}{\percent} glacial acetic acid. This results in the binding of the silane to active hydroxyl groups.
At this stage the silane is not yet covalently bound, but this is achieved by baking the cover slips in an oven at \SI{65}{\celsius} for \SI{3}{\hour}.
After this treatment, the cover slips were sonicated for \SI{10}{\minute} and washed with methanol.
Dried with clean nitrogen, they were left in a desiccator overnight. 
The next day they were treated with a mixture of \SI{5}{\mg\per\ml} methoxy-PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide (MW~2000, Laysan Bio) and \SI{0.05}{\mg\per\ml} biotin-peg-N-hydroxysuccinimide (MW 3400, Laysan Bio) in \SI{50}{\mM} phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4.
This creates a surface containing biotin and methoxy end groups.
The PEG surface prevents nonspecific adsorption of the protein.
The slides were dried with a gentle flow of nitrogen and stored in a desiccator until further use.

\paragraph*{Protein immobilization.}
The biotin functionalized glass slide was incubated with \SI{20}{\mM} PBS pH 7.4 buffer for \SI{5}{\minute}.
\SI{100}{\nM} of NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific) was incubated for another \SI{15}{\minute} and then washed to remove unbound Neutravidin. 
Then \SI{100}{\pM} of the labeled protein was incubated for \SI{1}{\minute} to get isolated proteins (20 per \SI{100}{\um} area) to bind to the functionalized glass surface.
The unbound proteins were then removed by washing with fresh PBS buffer.

\paragraph*{Electrochemical-potential control.}
Once the unbound proteins were removed, a new mixture containing \SI{0.1}{\mM} sodium ascorbate (\ce{C6H7O6-Na+}) and \SI{0.2}{\mM} potassium ferricyanide (\ce{[Fe(CN)6^3-]}) in \SI{4}{\ml} PBS pH 7.4 was added to the sample.
The redox potential of the solution was further controlled by a potentiostat (Model 800B Series Electrochemical Detector, CH Instruments) with the same electrochemical set up as previously described\cite{zhang2017gold} with little modification.
A platinum rectangular grid (the total length/ width of the grid is around \SI{2.5}{\cm}) was used as working electrode and pressed onto the sample slide with the help of a small glass slide.
Not only is the pressure evenly applied on the grid, but also small confined volumes are formed where the sample slide and glass slide form the `floor' and `roof' and the platinum grid forms the `walls'.
These confined volumes are in the order of nanoliters, which makes switching of the elctrochemical potential of the solution possible in a matter of minutes.
The change in the solution potential changes the concentration of reductant and oxidant based on the Nernst equation.

\paragraph*{Confocal Microscope.}
Single-molecule measurements were carried out in a home-built confocal microscope.
The setup was equipped with a \SI{635}{\nm} pulsed diode laser (Power Technology, Little Rock, AR, USA) controlled by a PDL 828 "Sepia II" (PicoQuant) at \SI{40}{\MHz} repetition rate.
The laser beam was passed through a narrow-band cleanup filter (Semrock LD01-640/8-25) and coupled to a single-mode optical fiber to obtain a Gaussian beam profile.
The output beam was collimated and reflected by a polychroic mirror (z488/633rpc) onto the back aperture of an oil immersion objective (NA=1.4, Olympus UPLSApo 100x).
The sample holder with the glass slide and electrodes was mounted on a scanning stage (Physik Instrumente P-517.3CD) controlled by a nanopositioning system (Physik Instrumente E-710.3CD). 
The epifluorescence light was collected back through the same objective and focussed on a \SI{50}{\um} pinhole for spatial filtering, then the light passed through an emission filter (z488/635m "dual"-band emission filter, Chroma). 
The fluorescence beam was re-collimated and focussed on a single-photon avalanche photo diode (SPCM AQRH-15, Perkin Elmer Inc., USA).
The signal from the photo diode was recorded by a PicoHarp 300 (PicoQuant GmBH, Berlin, Germany) in time-tagged-time-resolved mode.

\paragraph*{Data recording.}
A \SI[product-units=repeat]{20x20}{\um} area of the sample surface functionalized with sparsely distributed ATTO655-labeled azurin was scanned with \SI{50}{\nm} per pixel and with a dwell time of \SI{1}{\ms} per pixel.
A typical fluorescence intensity image can be seen in Figure \ref{sch:setup}.
A constant potential of \SI{200}{\mV} vs SCE (oxidizing) was applied by the potentiostat and an image of \SI[product-units=repeat]{10x10}{\um} area was taken after \SI{2}{\minute}.
Typically within one minute, the solution potential of the mixture of \SI{0.1}{\mM} ascorbate and \SI{0.2}{\mM} ferricyanide reaches the applied potential.
Another image of this same area was recorded at \SI{0}{\mV} (reducing).
The two images were compared to identify the molecules that switch on and off at the two potentials (Figure-\ref{sch:setup} (8 \& 9)).
The coordinates of the switching molecules were registered and an automatic recording was started.
For each molecule, time traces were recorded for \SI{30}{\s} at different potentials between \SI{-100}{\mV} and \SI{-100}{\mV}.
To observe the dynamics of a single-molecule over longer period, time traces were recorded until the dye was  bleached or the protein was denaturated.
Zn-azurin-ATTO655 was used as a control since it doesn't show switching at the above potentials.
Time traces at the same potentials for the same durations were recorded as for the Cu-azurin.

\paragraph*{Data analysis.}
The measurements resulted in more than a 1000 time traces.
Each time trace contains the absolute arrival times of photons as well as the arrival time with respect to the excitation laser pulse.
This enabled us to extract maximum information from the traces.
To minimize accidental variation and improve efficiency, codes were written (in Python and Matlab) to standardize the analysis of the time traces.
% The codes and data can be found in the given link (will be provided during submission).
Each trace was analyzed in three ways (i) Intensity change points in the time traces were obtained using the Change-Point algorithm\cite{watkins2005detection} provided by prof. Haw Yang 
(Princeton University, USA).
This method is bin free and doesn't require any prior knowledge of the underlying kinetics.
It determines the location of intensity changes based on the photon arrival times and the algorithm is recursively applied over the whole time trace to find all the changes.
A Bayesian information criterion is used to find the number of states.
In the present case two states were identified from long time traces of many molecules (2500 changepoints each) with more than \SI{90}{\percent} accuracy.
This was in agreement with our prediction of two states namely a FRET quenched (low intensity) and a non-quenched state (bright).
Consequently the number of states for the other time traces have been set to two to minimize the computation time.
An example of a trace with change points and its overlap with the real time trace can be seen in Figure-\ref{fig:timetrace}.
(ii) Autocorrelation of the time traces were calculated using SymPhoTime(PicoQuant) software.
(iii) Further analysis of Change-Point outputs and the autocorrelation outputs were performed in Python.
% The details of the code including all the fitting functions can be found in the online repositories (will be provided during submission).

%%%%%%---------------------RESULTS and DISCUSSION-----------------------%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results and discussion\label{sec:results}}
\paragraph*{Time traces at different potentials.}
Active Cu-azurin molecules were identified from their fluorescence intensity images at the oxidizing (\SI{200}{\mV}) and reducing conditions(\SI{0}{\mV}).
In reducing conditions, the image contains many bright spots corresponding to Cu(I)-azurin-ATTO655 and more than \SI{90}{\percent} of the molecules are turned off in oxidizing conditions 
(Figure-\ref{sch:setup}(8)).
The azurins on each sample slide showed active switching during the course of the experiment (up to two days) without any noticeable degradation.
A set of active azurins were marked for recording and time traces at different potentials (between \SI{100}{\mV} and \SI{100}{\mV}) were measured on the \texttt{same molecules} 
for \SI{30}{\s}.
Many of the labeled proteins bleached within the recording at a few potentials, but more than \SI{50}{\percent} of the labeled-azurin survived at least five measurements (\SI{150}{\s}  total) at different potentials.
Longer measurements were possible thanks to the scavenging of oxygen in the solution.
Before recording the time trace, the solution was exposed to a negative potential for at least \SI{1}{\hour}.
Ascorbate is known to  scavenge oxygen\cite{dave1997effectiveness} and get oxidized.
The oxidized ascorbate is then reduced by the electrode and is again available to scavenge other oxygen molecules.
In addition to the absence of oxygen, the  oxidizing-and-reducing-system(ROXS) mechanism was also at play.\cite{cordes2009on}
The reduction and oxidation of Cu-azurin made the dye switch on and off, hence the fluorescent dye spent less time in the bright state, and thus was less prone to bleaching.
We could measure some fluorescence time traces for more than \SI{1000}{\s}.\\
%---time trace

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figure_1_timetrace_CuAzu}
	\caption{Time traces of the same Cu-azurin-ATTO655 at different potentials (0, 50 and \SI{100}{\mV} with respect to SCE).
	The structure of the protein with properly positioned dye can be seen in the schematic picture in the left.
	In the Cu(II) state (shown as blue dot in the protein structure), the dye is non fluorescent because of FRET and in the Cu(I) state (shown as as a gray dot), the dye is fluorescent. Notice the amount of time the protein spends in the bright and the dark state at different potentials.
	At lower potentials (e.g \SI{0}{\mV}) the protein is bright most of the time because of the higher concentration of reductant.}
	\label{fig:timetrace}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:timetrace} shows time traces of a single Cu-azurin-ATTO655 molecule at three different potentials. 
The intensity changes from bright to dark and vice versa over time (Figure \ref{fig:timetrace}).
The dark state is due to FRET from the dye to the Cu(II) absorption center\cite{kuznetsova2006a}.
Bulk (ensemble) measurements of the fluorescence intensity at completely oxidizing and completely reducing condition shows \SI{90}{\percent} switching ratio (Figure S\ref{SIfig: switching}) for the lysine-122 labeled Cu-azurin-ATTO655.\cite{nicolardi2012topdown}
In the single-molecule traces in Figure \ref{fig:timetrace}, the quenched state is same as the background signal in absence of the protein.
A measurement (Figure S\ref{SIfig: lifetime}) at a higher laser power(\SI{0.7}{\uW}) show that single azurin too show \SI{90}{\percent} switching in their fluorescence, which is consistent with the bulk measurements.
The intensity of the Cu(II)-state is lower than the intensity of the Cu(I)-state, but higher than the background (bleached state).
Also the Cu(II)-state has a shorter lifetime (\SI{0.3}{\ns}) than the Cu(I)-state (\SI{1.9}{\ns}), but longer than the instrument response function (\SI{0.2}{\ns}). 
Both intensity and life time confirm that the dim state is FRET-quenched.
The high FRET efficiency is due to the small distance of the dye to the absorption center.
This clear distinction between the on and off state was very important for the low laser power and lower signal measurements.
At higher potential (\SI{100}{\mV}), the protein spends most of its time in its dark state and as the potential is lowered, the molecule spends more and more time in bright state.
This longer on-times at lower potentials is due to the increase in the concentration of the reductant species in the solution.
A control study with Zn-azurin-ATTO655 (Figure S\ref{SIfig:tracecomparision} and Figure S\ref{SIfig:fcscomparision}) shows that the dye itself blinks below \SI{40}{\mV}.
Zn-azurin is inert to redox changes and thus the blinking can only originate from the interaction of the dye with the reductant through photo excited electron transfer.
To simplify the analysis, therefore only potentials above \SI{40}{\mV} were considered for the Cu-azurin-ATTO655 study.\\

%Midpoint histogram
\paragraph*{Midpoint potential of single azurins.}
Figure \ref{fig:midpoint}a shows the ratio between the average off-time ($\me{t}_{off}$) and average on-time($\me{t}_{on}$) plotted against the applied potential.
The relationship of this ratio with the potential is given by the Nernst equation: 
\begin{equation}
	E = E_0 - \frac{k_BT}{n e}\ln\left(\frac{\me{t}_{on}}{\me{t}_{off}}\right)\,
	\label{eq:nernst}
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the applied potential, $E_0$ the midpoint potential, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, $n$ the number of electrons involved in the reaction and $e$ the electron charge.
The value of $n$ was found to be $1$ from the data analysis when the slope in the Nernst equation is kept as a free parameter (see Figure-S\ref{SIfig:potential_slope}).
Each color represents a single-azurin and the solid line connecting the points is the fit with the Nernst equation.
Labeled proteins surviving at least three potentials above \SI{40}{\mV} were used for the fit.
The potential at which the off-on ratio equals $1$ is the midpoint potential.
The distribution of midpoint potentials (Figure \ref{fig:midpoint}b) from \SI{132}{ molecules} can be fitted by a Gaussian with a center value of $\left<E_0^{SM}\right>=4.5 \pm 1.2~mV$ and a full width half maximum (fwhm) of $\sigma^{SM}=36 \pm 3~mV$. 
The midpoint potentials are similar to previously reported values of $6\pm0.6~mV$ with $fwhm=\SI{150}{\mV}$ where each $E_0$ was calculated from a cluster of about \SI{1000}{ molecules}.\cite{davis2006monitoring}
Another work reported $E_0 = \SI{16}{\mV}$ with low surface coverage (\SI{100}{\s} of azurins) with a fwhm of \SI{70}{\mV}.\cite{salverda2010fluorescent} 
Recently, for truly single azurin, a midpoint potential of $E_0=12\pm3$ was reported with fwhm of \SI{92}{\mV}.\cite{akkilic2014chemically-induced}\\
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figure_2_midpoint}
	\caption{Ratio between on and off times as a function of applied potential for the same single azurin.
	Different colors represent different single molecules.
	The line connecting the data points is the Nernst fit with $n=1$ for all the data points above \SI{40}{\mV}.
	The plot at the right is the histogram of midpoint potentials for \SI{132}{ molecules} with a Gaussian fit with a center value of \SI{4.5}{\mV} with respect to calomel electrode.}
	\label{fig:midpoint}
\end{figure}

The small width of the distribution (\SI{36}{\mV}) of single-azurin midpoint potentials in this work is obtained probably because of the way the proteins are functionalized to the surface.
The azurin is attached to a PEG-chain with a length of ${\sim}\SI{20}{\nm}$.
The PEG chain is attached to the surface through NeutrAvidin.
Such functionalization minimizes the interaction of the protein with the surface.
Indeed, no proteins was bound to the surface if the Neutravidin is taken out showing the non-sticking nature of the protein.
In previous experiments, the azurin was either non-specifically attached to the surface or attached through a very short linker (\SI{<1}{\nm}).
Surface interactions with different hydrophobic and charged patches on the protein can alter the ET functionality of the enzyme.

%====================Many single-molecule on-off histogram and their rates=================
\paragraph*{Intermediate detection from on-off histogram.}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{many_sm_hist}
	\caption{\textbf{Electron transfer rates (many molecules)} The histogram of on-times (a) and off-times (b) obtained from 132 single-Cu-azurin-ATTO655 molecules at \SI{100}{\mV} with their zoomed in part in the inset.
	Notice the single exponential decay of on-times and the bi-exponential (with rise time) for the off-times.
	This indicates that  reduction of Cu-azurin occurs through an intermediate step while for oxidation the intermediate state is not observable.
	The solid line is the corresponding single-exponential fit to the distribution.
	(c) The rate constant for oxidation as a function of the potential. 
	(d) The rate constant for reduction as a function of redox potential: blue points correspond to the faster rate constant (rise, $k_2$) while the red points represent the slow rate constant ($k_3$).}
	\label{fig:many_sm_hist}
\end{figure}
The number of on-off events for a single azurin was limited by fluoresce bleaching and led to noisy distribution.
For this reason we first analyzed the overall distribution of on- and off-times of all the single molecules obtained at a certain potential which basically can be considered as ensemble measurement.
Figure \ref{fig:many_sm_hist}(a) shows the histogram of on-times at \SI{100}{\mV} and the solid line is the fit of a single exponential with a time constant ($k_{1}$) of \SI{155}{\per\s}.
The on-time represents the time the protein spends in the reduced state before getting oxidized according to the following reaction scheme:
\begin{align}
	\ch{!(bright)(Cu(I)Az) + oxd <=>[ $k_1$ ][ $k_{-1}$ ] !(dark)(Cu(II)Az) + red }
	\label{eq:oxidation}
\end{align}
In contrast, the distribution of off-times shows a non-exponential distribution with a rise time (Figure \ref{fig:many_sm_hist}(a)).
The inset with binning time \SI{5}{\ms} clearly shows that the probability of finding very short off-times is relatively small.
This distribution can be explained with the Michaelis-Menten mechanism:
\begin{align}
	\ch{!(dark)(Cu(II)Az) + red <=>[ $k_2$ ][ $k_{-2}$ ] !(dark)(Cu(II)Az.red) -> [ k3 ] !(bright)(Cu(I)Az) + oxd}
	\label{eq:reduction}
\end{align}
where $k_2$ is the pseudo-first order rate constant which depends on the concentration of reductant and $k_3$ is the zero order rate constant which should be independent of the concentration of the substrate.
When assuming $k_{-2}=0$, the probability distribution of off times is given by\cite{lu1998single-molecule}
\begin{equation}
	P(t_{off}) = \frac{k_2k_3}{k_3-k_2} [exp(-k_2t_{off})-exp(-k_3t_{off})]
	\label{eq:2exp_risetime}
\end{equation}
At \SI{100}{\mV}, $k_2$ for the reduction is \SI{4.1}{\per\s} while $k_3$ is \SI{135}{\per\s}.
The data doesn't match with a single component distribution which is not surprising as the distribution is built from many single azurins and each azurin has its own decay.
Similar to the distribution in midpoint potential, the non-exponential distribution is a reflection of the statistical heterogeneity among the azurins.

The rates were determined at different applied potentials.
As expected the rate constant for the intermediate complex formation ($k_3$) is dependent on the substrate concentration thereby the potential while the rate constant for electron transfer in the intermediate is independent of the potential (Figure \ref{fig:many_sm_hist}(c)).
The rate of complex formation can be modeled as:
\begin{equation}
	k_3 =k_3^0\times[R] \text{ and } k_1 =k_1^0\times[Ox]
	\label{eq:rate_complex}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	[R] = \frac{R_0exp(\frac{E_0^R-E}{0.059})}{1+exp(\frac{E_0^R-E}{0.059})}
	\text{ and } [O] = \frac{O_0}{1+exp(\frac{E_0^O-E}{0.059})}
	\label{eq:conc_potential}
\end{equation}
$[R]$ is the concentration of reductant (equivalent to ``substrate'' in enzymology), $R_0$ is the starting concentration of reductant in the potentiometry which is equal to the concentration of Ascorbate in this case, $E_0^R$ is the standard redox potential of Ascorbate that is \SI{30}{\mV} and $E$ is the applied potential. The value $0.059$ stands for $\frac{RT}{nF}$ similar to the slope in the Nernst equation(Eq. \ref{eq:nernst}) with $n=1$.
Similarly $[O]$ represents the concentration of the oxidant (Ferricyanide) at different applied potential.
The maximum rate constant of reduction ($k_3^0$) was obtained to be $3.3\times10^5~M^{-1}s^{-1}$ while the maximum rate constant oxidation was $1.3\times10^8~M^{-1}s^{-1}$.
%==================Dynamics: Single-azurin over time===================
\paragraph*{Dynamical heterogeneity.}
After looking at ${\sim}150$ single-azurins together in an ensemble fashion, we investigated single azurins for as long time as their fluorescence survived.
Figure \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace} shows the statistics of a single-azurin at \SI{100}{\mV} that survived for \SI{\sim350}{\s}.
Zoom-in of two different parts of the original time trace are shown in Figure \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace}A and B with the respective part color-shaded in the trace Figure in \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace}C.
The two zoom-in traces have very different on-off characteristics, the one on the left has short on-times and long off-times while the one on the right has long on-times and short off-times.
The time trace was divided into small parts and the average was calculated over every $10$ consecutive on- and off-times (Figure \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace}E,G).
The averaging was done to smooth out the noise and to show few number of points on the whole trace which makes it easy to observe the difference.
Unlike random (Gaussian) noise, spikes and correlated high-low events are observed on the on-and off-trace which is also reflected in the density of points per unit time, longer on and off-times resulting lower density of points.
The histogram of on- and off-times are shown on the left side of the on-off-trace without any averaging and the fit is shown with a single exponential function.
The distribution is clearly non-exponential as can be seen from the big deviation from an exponential fit.
The trace of midpoint potential (Figure \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace}I) is calculated from each point on the on-off-trace and the applied potential based on the Nernst equation.
The midpoint potentials in the trace also fluctuates in a non-random way which can also be seen in its non-Gaussian distribution (Figure \ref{fig:long_azurin_trace}H) with an average value of \SI{42.2}{\mV}.

The heterogeneity in the on- and off-times is related to the heterogeneity in the rate of electron transfer particularly the longer on-off-times which is the rate of intermediate-complex formation.
The first reason we should consider is the effect of surface.
Previous study shows that the azurin can stick to the hydrophobic surface through the different hydrophobic patches on the protein surface.\cite{patil2010visualizing,salverda2010fluorescent,akkilic2014chemically-induced}
However, special care was taken to keep the protein as separated as possible from the surface thorough non-interacting PEG-surface and through a long (\SI{\sim20}{\nm}) linker.
Indeed no azurin was found attached to the surface of the substrate when the labeled azurin was flown onto the surface without Neutravidin or Biotin (everything else in the functionalization method kept same) indicating the non-sticky nature of the surface.
The narrow distribution (narrower than any measurement before) of midpoint potentials among the 132 single azurins (Figure \ref{fig:midpoint}) also indicates the absence of interaction with the surface.
From these observations, the surface contribution to the heterogeneity can safely be ignored.
Also the solution potential controlled by the potentiostat is very stable and the concentration of the reductant and oxidant can be considered non-changing and in steady state.

The heterogeneity in the rates can now only attributed to the changes in the conformation in the protein.
These changes are much smaller(\SI{<4}{\kJ\per\mole}) in comparison with the change in the free energy(\SI{-23}{\kJ\per\mole}, $\Delta{G}=-nEF$) related to the change in the oxidation state of azurin.
Such small changes can be attributed subtle changes in the structure of the protein, each of these sub-structure are called conformational sub-states.

The protein remains in a certain conformational sub-states for a duration of time which can be observed in the time trace.
A short on-time followed by short on-time represents one state while a long on-time followed by long on-time represents another sub-state.
The residence time in each of these conformational sub-states can be characterized by autocorrelating the time trace of on- and off-times (Figure \ref{fig:Dynamic_corr} A).
The characteristic decay times are in the order of $10s$ of seconds, however the decay time for on- and off-events are not the same.
The signature of the changes in the rates can also be seen in the intensity correlation (Figure \ref{fig:Dynamic_corr}B) with a decay at round \SI{\sim50}{\s} which basically has both the information about the on- and off-rates.
However, the individual rates related to on- and off-time can't be extracted from the intensity correlation unless the underlying the kinetics is known.

In 1980s, conformational sub-states were observed in the association and dissociation of carbon monoxide (CO) with myoglobin in bulk experiment where sub-populations were found with different binding rates of CO.
The time scales of binding were stretched from microseconds to seconds indicating all possible conformations of myoglobin.
Indication of heterogeneity has also been observed for single-enzymes with some success($\beta$-galactosidase, flavoenzymes)\cite{lu1998single-molecule,kou2005single-molecule,english2006ever-fluctuating}.
Here the dynamic rates can be observed for single azurin in the time scale of 10s of seconds which varies from protein to protein as can be seen in SI Fig. S\ref{SIfig:Dynamic_corr_many}
As the rate of oxidation and reduction occur in the range of 100s of milliseconds, conformational changes in the shorter times scale can't be determined.
Among the proteins that were recorded, no two proteins seemed to have the same dynamics indicating the vast number of conformational sub-states that a protein can take.
It was almost impossible to experimentally build a map of such a large number of states.

% Some proteins were also found to have no decay in the correlation (e.g. Figure \ref{fig: N_avgpoints_vs_fwhmwidth}C), primarily indicating the absence of dynamical heterogeneity.
% Looking back at the histogram of midpoint potentials obtained from 132 single azurins, can the contribution of dynamical heterogeneity be estimated to the distribution (fwhm=\SI{36}{\mV}) for all the single-azurins.

% Also midpoint potentials were calculated from each average on and average off times using the Nernst equation(\ref{eq:nernst}).
% As both on-and off-times change over time, the midpoint potential too changes over time. 
% The distribution of $E_0$ shows a center value of $2\pm0.2~mV$ with a fwhm of \SI{26}{\mV}.
% This distribution of midpoint potential of a single-azurin over a long time is similar to the value of \SI{36}{\mV} obtained from many single-azurins.

\section{Conclusion}
The results presented here show how to controllably switch the solution potential and determine the switching ratio of redox active azurin.
By introducing non-interacting surface and long linker, very narrow distribution in the midpoint potential obtained.
The distribution over many single-azurin was found to be very close to the distribution of a single-azurin over long time.
The rate of intermediate formation for the reduction process has been observed conferring to Michaelis-Menten mechanism.
The intermediate formation for the oxidation was too fast to be detected with our signal to noise ratio.
In principle similar measurement at higher laser power and for many molecules should enable the detection of the intermediate if there is any.
For the first time, correlated dynamics observed in the ET azurin.
We showed several ways like non-exponential distribution rates of ET, non-Gaussian distribution of midpoint potentials, correlations of the rates of ET and correlation of intensities to  characterize the dynamic-heterogeneity in the activity of the protein.
Our study convincingly proves the presence of conformational heterogeneity in an enzyme and we expect to have similar heterogeneity in all types enzymes and electron transfer proteins in the nature.
