		  understanding of single-molecule kinetics associated with
		  the Michaelis−Menten mechanism of enzymatic reactions.
		  Single-molecule enzymatic turnover experiments typically
		  measure the probability density f(t) of the stochastic
		  waiting time t for individual turnovers. While f(t) can be
		  reconciled with ensemble kinetics, it contains more
		  information than the ensemble data; in particular, it
		  provides crucial information on dynamic disorder, the
		  apparent fluctuation of the catalytic rates due to the
		  interconversion among the enzyme's conformers with
		  different catalytic rate constants. In the presence of
		  dynamic disorder, f(t) exhibits a highly stretched
		  multiexponential decay at high substrate concentrations and
		  a monoexponential decay at low substrate concentrations. We
		  derive a single-molecule Michaelis−Menten equation for
		  the reciprocal of the first moment of f(t), 1/〈t〉,
		  which shows a hyperbolic dependence on the substrate
		  concentration [S], similar to the ensemble enzymatic
		  velocity. We prove that this single-molecule
		  Michaelis−Menten equation holds under many conditions, in
		  particular when the intercoversion rates among different
		  enzyme conformers are slower than the catalytic rate.
		  However, unlike the conventional interpretation, the
		  apparent catalytic rate constant and the apparent Michaelis
		  constant in this single-molecule Michaelis−Menten
		  equation are complicated functions of the catalytic rate
		  constants of individual conformers. We also suggest that
		  the randomness parameter r, defined as 〈(t −
		  〈t〉)2〉/〈t〉2, can serve as an indicator for
		  dynamic disorder in the catalytic step of the enzymatic
		  reaction, as it becomes larger than unity at high substrate
		  concentrations in the presence of dynamic disorder.},
