  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in photobleaching and blinking prevention have aided the advancement of single-molecule and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. However, a common mechanism of the action of antifading agents such as Trolox is still missing. In this communication we present evidence that Trolox acts in accordance with a mechanism that involves triplet quenching through electron transfer and subsequent recovery of the resulting radical ion by the complementary redox reaction. The required oxidant for this unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting results regarding the action of antifading agents and might lead to a common mechanistic understanding of photobleaching and its prevention. Finally, a recipe on the proper use of Trolox as an antifading agent is provided.},

Hydrogen peroxide content was initially higher in the products prepared with starter cultures that contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. During storage of yoghurt, increase in oxygen content and redox potential and percentage retention of ascorbic acid were identical for all four starter cultures, but different at various levels of ascorbic acid. The oxygen content and redox potential gradually increased during storage in plastic cups and remained lower with higher levels of ascorbic acid. Loss of ascorbic acid occurred during manufacture and storage, with an average retention of only 15--20\% after about 35 days storage of yoghurt at 4 Â°C. The viable counts of Streptococcus thermophilus were lower, whereas those of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were higher, with increasing concentration of ascorbic acid. The counts of Lactobacillus acidophilus during storage decreased less rapidly with increasing concentration of acsorbic acid for all four starter cultures, whereas the counts of bifidobacteria remained unchanged.},

Our ability to monitor the redox-active state of immobilized proteins or enzymes at a molecular level, from which stochastic and surface-induced variations would be apparent, is impeded by comparatively slow electron-transfer kinetics and associated signal:noise difficulties. We demonstrate herein that by covalently tethering an appropriate dye to the copper protein azurin a highly oxidation-state-sensitive FRET process can be established which enables redox switching to be optically monitored at protein levels down to the zeptomolar limit. The surface-potential-induced cycling of emission enables the redox potential of clusters of a few hundred molecules to be determined.},

The classic Michaelis-Menten mechanism provides a highly satisfactory description of catalytic activities for large ensembles of enzyme molecules. Here we tested the Michaelis-Menten equation at the single-molecule level. We monitored long time traces of enzymatic turnovers for individual beta-galactosidase molecules by detecting one fluorescent product at a time. A molecular memory phenomenon arises at high substrate concentrations, characterized by clusters of turnover events separated by periods of low activity. Such memory lasts for decades of timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds owing to the presence of interconverting conformers with broadly distributed lifetimes. We proved that the Michaelis-Menten equation still holds even for a fluctuating single enzyme, but bears a different microscopic interpretation.},

Contrary to the more common three-domain MCOs, a tyrosine in the two-domain SLAC is found to participate in the enzyme mechanism by providing an electron during oxygen reduction, giving rise to the temporary appearance of a tyrosyl radical. The relatively low k(cat)/K(M) of SLAC and the involvement of Y108 in the enzyme mechanism may reflect an adaptation to a milieu in which there is an imbalance between the available reducing and oxidizing co-substrates. The purported evolutionary relationship between the two-domain MCOs and human ceruloplasmin appears to extend not only to the 3D structure and the mode of binding of the Cu's in the trinuclear center, as noted before, but also to the enzyme mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The azurin-encoding azu gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A purification procedure was developed to isolate the azurin obtained from the E. coli cells. No differences were observed between azurins isolated from P. aeruginosa and E. coli. A non-reconstitutable azurin-like protein, azurin*, with a spectral ratio (A625/A280) less than 0.01 could be separated from holo-azurin with a spectral ratio of 0.58 (+/- 0.01). The properties of azurin* were examined by electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE and IEF) and spectroscopic (UV/vis, 1H-NMR, static and dynamic fluorescence) techniques, and compared to the properties of holo-azurin and apo-azurin. Azurin* resembles apo-azurin (same pKa* values of His-35 and His-117, same fluorescence characteristics). However, it has lost the ability to bind Cu-ions. It is tentatively concluded that azurin* is a chemically modified form of azurin, the modification possibly being due to oxidation of the ligand residue Cys-112 or the formation of a chemical bond between the ligand residues Cys-112 and His-117. In agreement with previous results from Hutnik and Szabo (Biochemistry (1989) 28, 3923-3934), fluorescence experiments show that the heterogeneous fluorescence decay observed for holo-azurin is not due to the presence of azurin*, but most likely originates from conformational heterogeneity of the holo-azurin.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper summarizes our present theoretical understanding of single-molecule kinetics associated with the MichaelisâMenten mechanism of enzymatic reactions. Single-molecule enzymatic turnover experiments typically measure the probability density f(t) of the stochastic waiting time t for individual turnovers. While f(t) can be reconciled with ensemble kinetics, it contains more information than the ensemble data; in particular, it provides crucial information on dynamic disorder, the apparent fluctuation of the catalytic rates due to the interconversion among the enzyme's conformers with different catalytic rate constants. In the presence of dynamic disorder, f(t) exhibits a highly stretched multiexponential decay at high substrate concentrations and a monoexponential decay at low substrate concentrations. We derive a single-molecule MichaelisâMenten equation for the reciprocal of the first moment of f(t), 1/â©tâª, which shows a hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration [S], similar to the ensemble enzymatic velocity. We prove that this single-molecule MichaelisâMenten equation holds under many conditions, in particular when the intercoversion rates among different enzyme conformers are slower than the catalytic rate. However, unlike the conventional interpretation, the apparent catalytic rate constant and the apparent Michaelis constant in this single-molecule MichaelisâMenten equation are complicated functions of the catalytic rate constants of individual conformers. We also suggest that the randomness parameter r, defined as â©(t â â©tâª)2âª/â©tâª2, can serve as an indicator for dynamic disorder in the catalytic step of the enzymatic reaction, as it becomes larger than unity at high substrate concentrations in the presence of dynamic disorder.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescent protein labeling has been an indispensable tool in many applications of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological research. Although detailed information about the labeling stoichiometry and exact location of the label is often not necessary, for other purposes, this information is crucial. We have studied the potential of top-down electrospray ionization (ESI)-15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry to study the degree and positioning of fluorescent labeling. For this purpose, we have labeled the Cu-protein azurin with the fluorescent label ATTO 655-N-hydroxysuccinimide(NHS)-ester and fractionated the sample using anion exchange chromatography. Subsequently, individual fractions were analyzed by ESI-15T FTICR to determine the labeling stoichiometry, followed by top-down MS fragmentation, to locate the position of the label. Results showed that, upon labeling with ATTO 655-NHS, multiple different species of either singly or doubly labeled azurin were formed. Top-down fragmentation of different species, either with or without the copper, resulted in a sequence coverage of approximately 50\%. Different primary amine groups were found to be (potential) labeling sites, and Lys-122 was identified as the major labeling attachment site. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that anion exchange chromatography in combination with ultrahigh resolution 15T ESI-FTICR top-down mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for measuring fluorescent labeling efficiency and specificity.},

  Abstract                 = {In coupling the redox state of an adsorbed molecule to its spectral characteristics redox profiles can be directly imaged by means of far-field fluorescence. At suitable levels of dilution, on optically transparent electrode surfaces, reversible interfacial electron transfer processes can be followed pixel by pixel down to scales which approach the molecular. In mapping out switching potentials across a surface population, thermodynamic dispersion, related to variance in the orientation, electronic coupling, protein fold, electric field drop, and general surface order, can be quantified. The self-assembled monolayer buffering the protein from the underlying metallic electrode surface not only acts to tune electronic coupling between the two but also potentially provides a variable more easily segmented from other contributions to molecular dispersion. We have, specifically, considered the possibility that the supporting monolayer crystallinity is a significant contributor to the subsequently observed spread in half-wave potentials. We report here that this is indeed the case and that this spread diminishes from 17 to 12 mV for the blue copper protein azurin as the supporting alkanethiol layer crystallinity increases. The work herein, then, presents not only a direct determination of submonolayer scale variance in redox character but also a means of tuning this through gross surface and entirely standard chemical means.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for the analysis of optical single molecule emission data that exhibit discrete intensity jumps. This new method uses a generalized likelihood ratio test that determines the location of an intensity change point based on individual photon arrival times. This test is applied recursively to an entire single molecule intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points. Expectationâmaximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

To overcome the low fluorescence quantum yield of MB we enhanced fluorescence by using individual gold nanorods to achieve the required sensitivity. By measuring the same molecule at different electrochemical potentials we determined the mid-point potential of each single molecule through its redox-induced fluorescence blinking dynamics.},
