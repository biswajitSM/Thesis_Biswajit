  abstract	= {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool
		  in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has
		  also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in
		  medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date
		  all the fluorescence observables, including spectral
		  shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have
		  all been utilized in basic and applied uses of
		  fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a
		  new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay
		  engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of
		  fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing
		  their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence
		  experiments the radiative rates are not changed because
		  these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the
		  fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by
		  quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental
		  effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in
		  the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or
		  resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the
		  emission by providing additional routes for decay of the
		  excited states without emission. In contrast to the
		  relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is
		  known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing
		  the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic
		  surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from
		  the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of
		  metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or
		  decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of
		  low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes,
		  and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific
		  directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the
		  emitted photons, but rather as the result of the
		  fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the
		  metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal
		  and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the
		  unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative
		  rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical
		  fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can
		  result in an effective increase in photostability.
		  Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the
		  local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict
		  that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near
		  particles can result in usefully high emission from
		  “nonfluorescent” molecules and million-fold increases
		  in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore.
		  We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing
		  and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby
		  metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic
		  quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA
		  detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced
		  fluorescence.},
