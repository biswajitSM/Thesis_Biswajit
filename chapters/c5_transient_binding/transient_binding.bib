		  nm. Furthermore, no significant difference between the
		  surface coverage of hydrophilic and lipophilic ligands with

  abstract	= {Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and
		  complex optical properties. Examples include the intense
		  colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance
		  absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited
		  fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the
		  interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and
		  surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased
		  fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on
		  fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain
		  directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal
		  films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to
		  predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a
		  colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or
		  enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how
		  the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained
		  using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs).
		  The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is
		  simple to understand. According to the RP model, the
		  emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can
		  be predicted from the optical properties of the metal
		  structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory,
		  and/or Maxwell’s equations. For example, according to Mie
		  theory and the size and shape of the particle, the
		  extinction of metal colloids can be due to either
		  absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by
		  absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering.
		  Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench
		  fluorescence because absorption is dominant over
		  scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance
		  fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant
		  over absorption. The ability of a metal’s surface to
		  absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching
		  requirements at the metal–sample interface. Wavenumber
		  matching considerations can also be used to predict whether
		  fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar
		  surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations
		  suggest that the so called “lossy surface waves” which
		  quench fluorescence are due to induced electron
		  oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because
		  wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the
		  energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy
		  surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of
		  the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model
		  provides a rational approach for designing
		  fluorophore–metal configurations with the desired
		  emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic
		  fluorophore technology.},

		  probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short

		  emission from Cy5 labeled on DNA probes. We found that the
