  \caption{\textbf{Binding to gold surface} The chemical structures of different components in the transient binding scheme.
  The docking strand is attached to the nanorod through DTPA, which has two thiols attached to the gold atoms.
  The sequence of the docking and the imager strand are shown with their complementary binding.
  The imager strand is labeled with Cy5 at its 5' end.
  The rest of the nanorod surface is functionalized with PEG350, which has 9 monomers giving it a length of \SI{\sim3}{\nm}.}

  \caption{A \SI[product-units=power]{10x10}{\um} scanning image of the surface of the substrate with gold nanorod functionalized with docking strand and mPEG7-SH.
  The solution contains \SI{100}{\nM} imager strand in PBS pH 7.4 buffer with \SI{500}{\mM} \ce{NaCl}.
  The image on the left shows counts per millisecond while the image on the right shows the lifetime.
  The spots on the lifetime image correspond to the gold nanorods as they have a much shorter lifetime than the instrument response function.}

  \caption{\textbf{Many single molecules bind to the same binding spot on the same nanorod.} Time traces of three different nanorods, each of them with a single binding site, but with different enhancement factors.
  The histogram of intensities for each time trace is shown on the right and the two peaks indicate the presence of only one observable docking strand.
  Notice the different binding kinetics of trace A and trace C although they have similar enhancement factors.}

  \caption{\textbf{Transient binding without nanorod:} (A) Schematic of the transient binding.
  The docking strand was immobilized on the surface through neutravidin and biotin bonding.
  The solution contained \SI{100}{\nM} imager-Cy5 in PBS pH 7.4 buffer.
  Scanning image  in the absense (B) and presence (C) of docking strand on the surface showing the specificity of binding of the imager to the docking strand.
  (D) Time trace of transient binding on a single neutravidin-docking site at \SI{\sim 0.1}{\kW\per\cm\squared} power density, 10 times higher than the laser power used for measurement on the nanorod. The burst heights are \SI{\sim 20}{ kcps} corresponding to single imager-Cy5.
  To compare with the bursts from nanorods and calculate the enhancement factor, the count rate can be divided by 10 to match the laser power on the nanorod as the intensity varies linearly at such low powers.
  A count rate of \SI{2}{ kcps} for unenhanced Cy5 has been used in the main text.
