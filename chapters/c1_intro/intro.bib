  Abstract                 = {NAD is a key determinant of cellular energy metabolism. In contrast, its phosphorylated form, NADP, plays a central role in biosynthetic pathways and antioxidant defence. The reduced forms of both pyridine nucleotides are fluorescent in living cells but they cannot be distinguished, as they are spectrally identical. Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches to perturb NAD(P)H metabolism, we find that fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) differentiates quantitatively between the two cofactors. Systematic manipulations to change the balance between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism suggest that these states do not directly impact NAD(P)H fluorescence decay rates. The lifetime changes observed in cancers thus likely reflect shifts in the NADPH/NADH balance. Using a mathematical model, we use these experimental data to quantify the relative levels of NADH and NADPH in different cell types of a complex tissue, the mammalian cochlea. This reveals NADPH-enriched populations of cells, raising questions about their distinct metabolic roles.},

The three bands are assigned to the transitions 2B2 leads to 2E, 2B2 leads to 2B1, and 2B2 leads to 2A1, respectively, in the slightly flattened tetrahedral blue copper centers. The ligand field theoretical treatment predicts a type 1 copper reduction potential of 417 mV. The MCD spectrum of ascorbate oxidase contains one major band at 14000 cm-1 (710 nm) and a very weak feature at 13 200 cm-1 (550 nm). The intensities of the CD and MCD bands are consistent with two or three type 1 coppers in each enzyme molecule, and the near-infrared spectroscopic results suggest that the electronic structures of the blue coppers are closely similar.},

We measure the number of molecules of a specified type in a defined open volume as a function of time and compute the time course of the deviations from the thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic departures from equilibrium which result from external perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the number of the specified molecules is measured by a property such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely spaced in free energy, small systems, and systems not readily subject to perturbations of state.},

Over a wide range of physiological conditions the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport was found to be directly proportional to the product of the photochemical fluorescence quenching (qQ) and the efficiency of excitation capture by open Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centres (Fv/Fm). A simple fluorescence parameter, ΔφF/φFm, which is defined by the difference in fluorescence yield at maximal φFm, and steady-state φFs, divided by φFm, can be used routinely to estimate changes in the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport. It is demonstrated that both the concentration of open PS II reaction centres and the efficiency of excitation capture by these centres will determine the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport in vivo and that deactivation of excitation within PS II complexes by non-photochemical processes must influence the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport.},

 fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be
 enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its
 SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement
 results from both an excitation rate enhancement of
 &#x223C;130 and an effective emission enhancement of
 &#x223C;9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases
 sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the
 excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a
 partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the
 fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence
 enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are
 consistent with numerical simulations.},

First introduced by Magde et al to measure the diffusion and binding of ethidium bromide onto double-stranded DNA, the technique has been undergoing a renaissance since 1993 with the implementation of confocal microscopy FCS. Since then, a flurry of experiments has implemented FCS to characterize the photochemistry of dyes, the translational and rotational mobilities of fluorescent molecules, as well as to monitor conformational fluctuations of green fluorescent proteins and DNA molecules. In this review, we present the analytical formalism of an FCS measurement, as well as practical considerations for the design of an FCS setup and experiment. We then review the recent applications of FCS in analytical chemistry, biophysics and cell biology, specifically emphasizing the advantages and pitfalls of the technique compared to alternative spectroscopic tools. We also discuss recent extensions of FCS in single-molecule spectroscopy, offering alternative data processing of fluorescence signals to glean more information on the kinetic processes.},

The described approach opens the door to single-molecule mechanistic studies of a wide range of redox enzymes and the precise investigation of their internal workings.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a new fluorescence imaging methodology in
 which the image contrast is derived from the fluorescence
 lifetime at each point in a two-dimensional image and not
 the local concentration and/or intensity of the
 fluorophore. In the present apparatus, lifetime images are
 created from a series of images obtained with a
 gain-modulated image intensifier. The frequency of gain
 modulation is at the light-modulation frequency (or a
 harmonic thereof), resulting in homodyne phase-sensitive
 images. These stationary phase-sensitive images are
 collected using a slow-scan CCD camera. A series of such
 images, obtained with various phase shifts of the
 gain-modulation signal, is used to determine the phase
 angle and/or modulation of the emission at each pixel,
 which is in essence the phase or modulation lifetime image.
 An advantage of this method is that pixel-to-pixel scanning
 is not required to obtain the images, as the information
 from all pixels is obtained at the same time. The method
 has been experimentally verified by creating lifetime
 images of standard fluorophores with known lifetimes,
 ranging from 1 to 10 ns. As an example of biochemical
 imaging we created lifetime images of Yt-base when quenched
 by acrylamide, as a model for a fluorophore in distinct
 environments that affect its decay time. Additionally, we
 describe a faster imaging procedure that allows images in
 which a specific decay time is suppressed to be calculated,
 allowing rapid visualization of unique features and/or
 regions with distinct decay times. The concepts and
 methodologies of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) have
 numerous potential applications in the biosciences.
 Fluorescence lifetimes are known to be sensitive to
 numerous chemical and physical factors such as pH, oxygen,
 temperature, cations, polarity, and binding to
 macromolecules. Hence the FLIM method allows chemical or
 physical imaging of macroscopic and microscopic samples.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade evidence has accumulated that small
 domains of 50–700nm in diameter are located in the
 exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Most of these
 domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and
 proteins, and are believed to coordinate signal
 transduction cascades. Whether similar domains are also
 present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane
 is unclear so far. To investigate the presence of
 cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting
 sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow
 fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence
 microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing
 in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were
 recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of
 individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent
 protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales
 from 5 to 200ms. The results show that the diffusion of
 30–40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a
 typical size of 200nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor
 cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics
 significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not
 be related to the membrane domains identified so far.},

  Abstract                 = {In most electronic imaging applications, images with high resolution (HR) are desired and often required. HR means that pixel density within an image is high, and therefore an HR image can offer more details that may be critical in various applications. For example, HR medical images are very helpful for a doctor to make a correct diagnosis. It may be easy to distinguish an object from similar ones using HR satellite images, and the performance of pattern recognition in computer vision can be improved if an HR image is provided. Since the 1970s, charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS image sensors have been widely used to capture digital images. Although these sensors are suitable for most imaging applications, the current resolution level and consumer price will not satisfy the future demand. For example, people want an inexpensive HR digital camera/camcorder or see the price gradually reduce, and scientists often need a very HR level close to that of an analog 35 mm film that has no visible artifacts when an image is magnified. Thus, finding a way to increase the current resolution level is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {The ever-improving time and space resolution and molecular
 detection sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy offer
 unique opportunities to deepen our insights into the
 function of chemical and biological catalysts. Because
 single-molecule microscopy allows for counting the turnover
 events one by one, one can map the distribution of the
 catalytic activities of different sites in solid
 heterogeneous catalysts, or one can study time-dependent
 activity fluctuations of individual sites in enzymes or
 chemical catalysts. By experimentally monitoring
 individuals rather than populations, the origin of complex
 behavior, e.g., in kinetics or in deactivation processes,
 can be successfully elucidated. Recent progress of temporal
 and spatial resolution in single-molecule fluorescence
 microscopy is discussed in light of its impact on catalytic
 assays. Key concepts are illustrated regarding the use of
 fluorescent reporters in catalytic reactions. Future
 challenges comprising the integration of other techniques,
 such as diffraction, scanning probe, or vibrational methods
 in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are
 suggested.},

Imaging of single fluorescence molecules has been achieved but has so far been restricted to molecules in the immobile state. Here we provide methodology for visualization of the motion of individual fluorescent molecules. It is applied to imaging of the diffusional path of single molecules in a phospholipid membrane by using phospholipids carrying one rhodamine dye molecule. For this methodology, fluorescence microscopy was carried to a sensitivity so that single fluorescent molecules illuminated for only 5 ms were resolvable at a signal/noise ratio of 28. Repeated illuminations permitted direct observation of the diffusional motion of individual molecules with a positional accuracy of 30 nm. Such capability has fascinating potentials in bioscience--for example, to correlate biological functions of cell membranes with movements, spatial organization, and stoichiometries of individual components.},

  Abstract                 = {Model experiments were performed with starved yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cultures in a batch reactor in order to develop a better understanding of NAD(P)H and flavin culture fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored during aerobic–anaerobic–aerobic transitions and ethanol and glucose substrate addition experiments. Interpretations of the fluorescence responses obtained are provided, with consideration given to redox compartmentation and the formation of ethanol shortly after a glucose addition. An analytical spectrofluorophotometer was interfaced to a personal computer and adapted to measure fluorescence in a bioreactor. This was achieved by the use of quartz fiber-optic waveguides to convert the right-angle cuvette geometry of the analytical spectrofluorophotometer to an open-ended fluorescence probe geometry, resulting in a flexible culture fluorescence apparatus. Features of the apparatus include variable excitation and emission wavelengths, allowing for detection of NAD(P)H or flavin fluorescence, as well as small slit widths, a variable sampling rate, excitation and emission scanning capabilities, and good sensitivity.},

Its amazing ability to generate a highly visible, efficiently emitting internal fluorophore is both intrinsically fascinating and tremendously valuable. High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function. GFP has become well established as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms. Mutagenesis and engineering of GFP into chimeric proteins are opening new vistas in physiological indicators, biosensors, and photochemical memories.},

In such a microscope, the imaging and condenser lenses are identical and confocal. These two lenses are replaced by a single lens when epi-illumination is used, making confocal imaging particularly applicable to incident light microscopy. We describe the results we have obtained with a confocal system in which scanning is performed by moving the light beam, rather than the stage. This system is considerably faster than the scanned stage microscope and is easy to use. We have found that confocal imaging gives greatly enhanced images of biological structures viewed with epifluorescence. The improvements are such that it is possible to optically section thick specimens with little degradation in the image quality of interior sections.},

 determination of the rate constants and characterization of
 the transition state. A rarely populated docked state, not
 measurable by ensemble methods, was observed. In the
 overall folding process, intermediate folding states and
 multiple folding pathways were observed. In addition to
 observing previously established folding pathways, a
 pathway with an observed folding rate constant of 1 per
 second was discovered. These results establish
 single-molecule fluorescence as a powerful tool for
