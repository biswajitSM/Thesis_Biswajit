		  which the image contrast is derived from the fluorescence
		  lifetime at each point in a two-dimensional image and not
		  the local concentration and/or intensity of the
		  fluorophore. In the present apparatus, lifetime images are
		  created from a series of images obtained with a
		  gain-modulated image intensifier. The frequency of gain
		  modulation is at the light-modulation frequency (or a
		  harmonic thereof), resulting in homodyne phase-sensitive
		  images. These stationary phase-sensitive images are
		  collected using a slow-scan CCD camera. A series of such
		  images, obtained with various phase shifts of the
		  gain-modulation signal, is used to determine the phase
		  angle and/or modulation of the emission at each pixel,
		  which is in essence the phase or modulation lifetime image.
		  An advantage of this method is that pixel-to-pixel scanning
		  is not required to obtain the images, as the information
		  from all pixels is obtained at the same time. The method
		  has been experimentally verified by creating lifetime
		  images of standard fluorophores with known lifetimes,
		  ranging from 1 to 10 ns. As an example of biochemical
		  imaging we created lifetime images of Yt-base when quenched
		  by acrylamide, as a model for a fluorophore in distinct
		  environments that affect its decay time. Additionally, we
		  describe a faster imaging procedure that allows images in
		  which a specific decay time is suppressed to be calculated,
		  allowing rapid visualization of unique features and/or
		  regions with distinct decay times. The concepts and
		  methodologies of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) have
		  numerous potential applications in the biosciences.
		  Fluorescence lifetimes are known to be sensitive to
		  numerous chemical and physical factors such as pH, oxygen,
		  temperature, cations, polarity, and binding to
		  macromolecules. Hence the FLIM method allows chemical or
		  physical imaging of macroscopic and microscopic samples.},

		  detection sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy offer
		  unique opportunities to deepen our insights into the
		  function of chemical and biological catalysts. Because
		  single-molecule microscopy allows for counting the turnover
		  events one by one, one can map the distribution of the
		  catalytic activities of different sites in solid
		  heterogeneous catalysts, or one can study time-dependent
		  activity fluctuations of individual sites in enzymes or
		  chemical catalysts. By experimentally monitoring
		  individuals rather than populations, the origin of complex
		  behavior, e.g., in kinetics or in deactivation processes,
		  can be successfully elucidated. Recent progress of temporal
		  and spatial resolution in single-molecule fluorescence
		  microscopy is discussed in light of its impact on catalytic
		  assays. Key concepts are illustrated regarding the use of
		  fluorescent reporters in catalytic reactions. Future
		  challenges comprising the integration of other techniques,
		  such as diffraction, scanning probe, or vibrational methods
		  in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are
