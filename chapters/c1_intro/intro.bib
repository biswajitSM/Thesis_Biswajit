		  specified type in a defined open volume as a function of
		  time and compute the time course of the deviations from the
		  thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on
		  the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous
		  microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same
		  phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic
		  departures from equilibrium which result from external
		  perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields
		  the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients
		  as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the
		  number of the specified molecules is measured by a property
		  such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and
		  sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined
		  by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules
		  appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to
		  diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration
		  fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the
		  intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents
		  the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and
		  diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light
		  intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of
		  general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical
		  reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand
		  to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a
		  unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially
		  useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively
		  noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely

		  which the image contrast is derived from the fluorescence
		  lifetime at each point in a two-dimensional image and not
		  the local concentration and/or intensity of the
		  fluorophore. In the present apparatus, lifetime images are
		  created from a series of images obtained with a
		  gain-modulated image intensifier. The frequency of gain
		  modulation is at the light-modulation frequency (or a
		  harmonic thereof), resulting in homodyne phase-sensitive
		  images. These stationary phase-sensitive images are
		  collected using a slow-scan CCD camera. A series of such
		  images, obtained with various phase shifts of the
		  gain-modulation signal, is used to determine the phase
		  angle and/or modulation of the emission at each pixel,
		  which is in essence the phase or modulation lifetime image.
		  An advantage of this method is that pixel-to-pixel scanning
		  is not required to obtain the images, as the information
		  from all pixels is obtained at the same time. The method
		  has been experimentally verified by creating lifetime
		  images of standard fluorophores with known lifetimes,
		  ranging from 1 to 10 ns. As an example of biochemical
		  imaging we created lifetime images of Yt-base when quenched
		  by acrylamide, as a model for a fluorophore in distinct
		  environments that affect its decay time. Additionally, we
		  describe a faster imaging procedure that allows images in
		  which a specific decay time is suppressed to be calculated,
		  allowing rapid visualization of unique features and/or
		  regions with distinct decay times. The concepts and
		  methodologies of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) have
		  numerous potential applications in the biosciences.
		  Fluorescence lifetimes are known to be sensitive to
		  numerous chemical and physical factors such as pH, oxygen,
		  temperature, cations, polarity, and binding to
		  macromolecules. Hence the FLIM method allows chemical or
		  physical imaging of macroscopic and microscopic samples.},

		  moving the light beam, rather than the stage. This system
		  is considerably faster than the scanned stage microscope
