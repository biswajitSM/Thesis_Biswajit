		  two gold nanoparticles (NPs) to DNA origami structures,
		  which also incorporated docking sites for a single
		  fluorescent dye next to one NP or in the gap between two
		  NPs. We measured the dependence of the fluorescence
		  enhancement on NP size and number and compare it to
		  numerical simulations. A maximum of 117-fold fluorescence
		  enhancement was obtained for a dye molecule positioned in
		  the 23-nanometer gap between 100-nanometer gold NPs. Direct
		  visualization of the binding and unbinding of short DNA
		  strands, as well as the conformational dynamics of a DNA
		  Holliday junction in the hotspot of the nanoantenna, show
		  the compatibility with single-molecule assays.},

		  fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be
		  enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its
		  SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement
		  results from both an excitation rate enhancement of
		  &#x223C;130 and an effective emission enhancement of
		  &#x223C;9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases
		  sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the
		  excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a
		  partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the
		  fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence
		  enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are
		  consistent with numerical simulations.},

		  and (ii) a fast component of about 1 ms, which could arise

		  Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields
		  when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman
		  scattering5, but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs
		  depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal
		  tips6 and colloids7, 8 can enhance fluorescence, the highly
		  enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated
		  bowtie nanoantennas9 provide a structure that is more
		  controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold
		  bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's

		  this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an
		  increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement
		  of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor
		  of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects.
		  Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for
		  high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.},
