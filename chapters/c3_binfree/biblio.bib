Abstract = {{The narrow fluorescence excitation lines of single aromatic molecules
   dissolved in polymers can be used to probe the low-temperature dynamics
   of the matrix. The shape and width of the spectrum, as well as the
   fluctuations of the fluorescence intensity of a single molecule can be
   interpreted in terms of two-level systems in its neighborhood, i.e., the
   disordered regions of the glass responsible for its specific dynamics at
   low temperatures. The observed characteristic times of the fluctuations
   and their dependence on temperature point to tunneling mechanisms,
   assisted in different ways by acoustical phonons.}},
