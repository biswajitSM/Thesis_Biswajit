\begin{abstract}
Gold nanorods are extensively used for single-molecule fluorescence enhancement applications since they are easy to synthesize, bio-compatible and provide high light confinement at their nanometer-sized tips. We report on a novel way to extract the enhancement factor in a single-molecule enhancement experiment using the interphoton delay distribution, avoiding the arbitrary binning of the fluorescence intensity time traces. We present experimental results on the bi-dimensional case, experimentally achieved using a lipid bi-layer to support the diffusion of fluorophores.  We support our findings with numerical simulations and a theoretical model to calculate the interphoton delay distribution of (nearly) immobilized emitters from the intensity profile.

Single quantum emitters such as fluorophores, quantum dots, color centers and fluorescent proteins have become powerful tools
for modern science since they provide nanometer-sized probes that can be used to extract local information about the 
local environment \cite{moerner1999illuminating, kulzer2010single}, oxidation state of molecules\cite{zhang2017gold}, 
proximity of other emitters \cite{stein2011single} and biological function\cite{} combined with the non-invasiveness of optical methods. 
%With the blossom of superlocalization and superresolution techniques, optical microscopy commonly pushed to sub-diffraction-limited scales \cite{klar2000fluorescence,betzig2006imaging}. Recent developments have achieved resolutions comparable with molecular sizes \cite{balzarotti2017nanometer,Weisenburger2017}, opening up the possibility of mapping nanoscale properties unprecedented resolution while keeping the advantages of optical microscopy.

-Fluorescence enhancement by plasmonic structures paragraph: physical origins, dependence, mention emission and excitation. limitations. motivate the quantification of enhancement in different structures.

Regardless of the origin of the fluorescence photons, a usual approach is to record the arrival time each individual 
photon in the so-called time-correlated single-photon counting approach (TCSPC) in a time-tagged 
time-resolved configuration (TTTR) \cite{Wahl_picoquant}. 
Thanks to the high-speed electronics and pulsed excitation sources available commercially, 
the absolute arrival times (also called macrotime) can be determined with picoseconds accuracy and, with the proper synchronization to the excitation source, the 'nanotime'\footnote{The usual denomination is microtime but we opt for nanotime to avoid confusion with the macrotime.} can be also determined. 
The nanotime is usually used to obtain the lifetime histogram, which can be used to 
gain insight into the underlying mechanism for the emission. For example, 
in the case of fluorescence, the radiative and non-radiative rates can be accessed experimentally with a 
measurement of the lifetime and the quantum-yield \cite{lakowicz2007principles}.
%Figure \ref{fg:tcspc} shows an time representation for such an experimental configuration. 
The output of a TTTR experiment can be represented as a classical function of time \cite{Lippitz2005}:

\begin{equation}
I(t) = \sum_i \delta( t-t_i)
\label{eq:intensity_TCSPC}
\end{equation}
where $\delta(t)$ is the usual definition for the Dirac's delta function and $t_i$ is the absolute arrival time
for each detected photon in the experiment (measured relative to the start of the experiment, the macrotime). 
We shall call this function \textit{unbinned time trace}.

The exciting source is a pulsed laser with MHz repetition rate and both the time tag $T$ since the start of the experiment and the TCSPC time $t$ are recorded and saved. The former can be used to calculate the interphoton delay distribution and the latter to generate a lifetime histogram to obtain, for example, the lifetime of a fluorescent molecule. Modified from \cite{Wahl_picoquant}.
%\label{fg:tcspc}}
 %\end{figure}

In spite of the high temporal resolution provided by such experiments, 
the usual way to characterize the emission of quantum emitters is to display the temporal 
fluctuations of the number of detected photons in a certain integration time (or binning time) and
complement this with the histogram of detected photon counts. Such a characterization inherently introduces
an arbitrary parameter, the binning or integration time, that may bias the obtained distributions.\cite{Lippitz2005}
Alternatively, correlation functions can be calculated from the unbinned time trace to exhibit the characteristic 
time of a process of interest, such as the diffusion time of molecules
in solution\cite{FCS}, triplet state blinking\cite{} or photon anti-bunching.\cite{}

Here we focus on the use of a less common quantity the \textit{interphoton delay distribution} $p(\tau)$
to characterize the emission of quantum emitters and to extract reliable information about an
emitting system avoiding the introduction of any arbitrary binning time. The interphoton delay 
distribution express the delay distribution between photons: after a photon detection, the probability
density to observe the next photon at a time $\tau$ is $p(\tau)$ ($p(\tau)\geq 0$). \cite{Verberk2003}
We present a model to relate this quantity to a distribution of intensities probed by a 
single quantum emitter in the limit of \textit{slow} diffusion and we show that it encodes information about the intensity distribution inside the volume accessible to diffuser. 
We will illustrate this point with single-molecule fluorescence 
in a bi-dimensional case both with Gaussian beam shape and in the case of enhanced fluorescence using
gold nanorods.



\section{Theoretical framework}

We seek to relate the interphoton delay distribution in a fluorescence experiment with 
the spatial distribution of intensities used to excite the fluorescent molecules. The interphoton
delay distribution was defined above and is represented by the probability density function $p(\tau)$. 
Thus the probability of detecting the next photon at a time 
$\tau+\mbox{d}\tau$ is $p(\tau)\mbox{d}\tau$ and the
normalization condition holds: $\int_0^{\infty}{p(\tau)\mbox{d}\tau}=1$.

Let us start from the simplest case of a constant detected intensity $w$ (in counts per second).
Such a signal gives rise to an exponentially distributed 
interphoton delay times, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
p(\tau)=w\exp(-w\tau)\,.
\label{eq:exponential_distribution}
\end{equation}
This is a direct consequence of the memory-free character of the photon emission, which leads to a Poisson distribution
of intensities and an exponential distribution of interphoton delays. We note that this distribution can be obtained
with a fluorescent molecule excited at a constant intensity, for example, a fixed molecule on a substrate
excited at a constant intensity. 

Let us now consider a distribution of intensities $Q(w)$ such that the intensity variations are much 
slower than the interphoton detection events. This will give rise to the interphoton delay distribution 
$p(\tau)=\int_0^\infty w e^{-w\tau}Q(w)\mbox{d}w$ that corresponds to averaging over all posible intensities 
(rates) $w$ and can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
p(\tau)=-\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d}\tau}\mathscr{L}\{Q(w)\}(\tau)\,,
\label{eq:interphoton_delay_distribution}
\end{equation} 
where $\mathscr{L}\{Q(w)\}(\tau)=\int_0^\infty e^{-w\tau}Q(w)\mbox{d}w$ denotes the 
Laplace transform of the function $Q(w)$ \footnote{Note that the Laplace transformation
is usually applied to time-dependent functions, giving rate-dependent functions. 
Here, we apply it to a function of the rate to obtain a time-dependent transform.}. 
If we would like to obtain the interphoton delay distribution 
corresponding to an addition of two sources with intensity distributions $P(w)$ and $Q(w)$ we can
use the total intensity $T(w)$ that can be calculated as the sum of a combined probability of soruce 1 
emitting at a rate $x$ and sorce 2 a $(w-x)$, i.e., by convoluting the two intensity functions: 
$T(w)=\int{P(x)Q(w-x)\mbox{d}x}$. s
Using the convolution theorem we can write the Laplace transform of the intensity distribution 
as the product of the Laplace transforms of the two distributions, from which we can deduce 
the interphoton delay distribution.

Let us now consider as a source one emitting object at position $\ve{r}$ diffusing around an optical intensity maximum, for example, a fluorescent molecule. The detected intensity will generally be a product of the position-dependent local excitation intensity and of a position-dependent collection efficiency and the molecular parameters involved in the emission process (absorption cross section, fluorescence quantum yield, etc. ). 
We write the product of these factors as a position-dependent intensity function $I(\ve{r})$. 

At this point we make two important approximations to continue. The first one is to neglect rotational diffusion of the molecules, which is a good approximation if we study times that are much longer than the rotational diffusion time. The second important approximation is to assume that translational diffusion is slow compared to the photon detection rate, that is to say, the molecules are fixed during the emission process. A complete theory relaxing this approximations would be much more complicated to develop and it is outside the scope of this work.

Under this approximations, the photon distribution can be deduced from the intensity distribution. The exploration of the diffusion volumes by the moving object gives rise to the following distribution of intensities for one moving object
\begin{equation}
Q_1(w)=\frac{1}{V}\int_V{\delta\left( w-I(\ve{r})\right)\mbox{d}^3r} \,,
\label{eq:intesity1}
\end{equation} 
where $\delta(x)$ represents the Dirac delta function and $V$ the volume accessible by the molecule.
In order to calculate the interphoton delay distribution using equation \ref{eq:interphoton_delay_distribution} we should compute the Laplace transform of $Q_1(w)$. This transformation results in 
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}\{Q_1(w)\}(\tau) = 1 -\lambda(\tau) \quad \mbox{where} \quad 
\lambda(\tau)\equiv \frac{1}{V}\int_V{ \{1-\exp[-I(\ve{r})\tau]\}\mbox{d}^3r} \, .
\label{eq:one-emitter}
\end{equation} 
Note that, for an intensity variation with a finite range around the center, for example due to Gaussian illumination and collection, $\lambda(\tau)$ is a small quantity which tends to zero for a large diffusion volume.  

We now consider the case of many ($N$) emitters with a concentration $C=\frac{N}{V}$ diffusing in a large volume. Using the argument presented before for two emitters, the addition of one emitter will modify the intensity distribution by convolution with the one-emitter distribution function $Q_1(\tau)$.
Using the convolution theorem for the Laplace transform, we can write the Laplace transform for the $N+1$ 
diffusers as
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}\{Q_{N+1}(w)\}(\tau) = \mathscr{L}\{Q_N(w)\}(\tau) \mathscr{L}\{Q_1(w)\}(\tau)\,,
\label{eq:laplace_N}
\end{equation}
from which we deduce $\mathscr{L}\{Q_{N}(w)\}(\tau)=\left[\mathscr{L}\{Q_{1}(w)\}(\tau)\right]^N $. Now we apply the statistical method of Stoneham \cite{STONEHAM1969, Fleury1995} by letting number and volume tend to infinity keeping the ratio constant to match the concentration $C$ to approximate

\begin{equation}
\ln\left[\mathscr{L}\{Q_{N}(w)\}(\tau)\right] = 
N\ln\left[1-\lambda(\tau)\right] \approx - C V \lambda(\tau)\,.
\label{eq:stoneham_approx}
\end{equation}

Therefore, using this result in equation \ref{eq:interphoton_delay_distribution} 
together with the definition from equation \ref{eq:laplace_N}, the general result for the histogram of interphoton delays for a concentration $C$ of emitters diffusing in a intensity maximum described by $I(\ve{r})$ 

\begin{equation}
p(\tau)=-\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d}\tau}\left[ \exp\left(-C \int_V{\left(1-\exp\left[-\tau I(\ve{r})\right] \right)}\mbox{d}^3\ve{r}    \right)\right]\,.
\label{eq:result}
\end{equation}

This is a general result that allows us to calculate the interphoton delay histogram for a solution 
with a concentration $C$ of (slowly) freely-diffusing objects around an illumination profile $I(\ve{r})$. 

\subsection{Photons per burst distribution}

Still need to revisit the theory and contrast with the experimental results.

\subsection{Diffusion case}

What happens if we add diffusion. Add qualitatively arguments of how the distribution is changed. mention the very fast
diffusion limit: it is a single exp. In the middle we have to say how we expect it to look.




\section{Two \textit{constant} different intensities}

In order to show that we can avoid the binning of our TTTR data to extract valuable information about our experiment, we studied the simple case of two constant detected intensities. In such a scenario, the interphoton delay distribution will be a biexponential function.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Transient_scheme}%
\caption{\textbf{Transient binding experimental scheme.} We used a home-made confocal microscope to excite and detect the imaging strand-Cy5 constructs in the solution. The signal from the molecules in the solution is low, thus we enhance the fluorescence signal using immobilized gold nanorods on a glass surface (average size: 45$\times$90 nm). In order to experimentally access the same spatial position in the plasmonic hot-spot we use the transient binding technique with a 15 base pair-long DNA as a docking strand and a 10base-pair-long imaging strand. The docking strand is attached to the gold nanorod surface using two tiol bonds, as shown in the inset. More details about the sample preparation can be found in the supplementary information. 
\label{fg:transient}}
\end{figure}

We experimentally access this situation by using fluorescence enhancement by gold nanorods. In fluorescence enhancement experiments with gold nanorods, a 1000-fold intensity enhancement can be achieved for weak dyes \cite{yuan2013thousandfold,khatua2014resonant}. However, this enhancement value depends strongly on the position of the molecule in the nanosale plasmonic hot-spot of the structure \cite{khatua2014resonant}, thus the challenge in such experiments is to place the dye molecules in the desired position to achieve high enhancement values. An elegant solution to place the molecules in the desired position is the technique called transient binding \cite{acuna2012fluorescence}.
Briefly, we use two complementary single-stranded DNA sequences, one attached to the surface of a gold nanorod and the other one is marked with a single Cy5 molecule (fluorescence quantum yield 0.27). The strand attached to the gold surface is  called the docking strand, since it allows the complementary strand to dock in one specific site and the latter is called the imaging strand since it allows fluorescence detection. 

This experimental scheme is shown in figure \ref{fg:transient}. We immobilized a gold nanorod on a glass surface and we have the imaging strands diffusing freely in the buffer solution. Details on the sample preparation can be found in the Supplementary Information.
When an imaging strand diffuses close to the docking strand, the DNA can be hybridized, forming a temporary double strand DNA. In that scenario, the single fluorescent label is placed in the plasmonic hot-spot of the nanorod and gets enhanced, giving a higher signal than the other molecules in the detection volume. 
This approach allows to put a single dye in a well-defined position in the near-field of the nanorod for a exponentially distributed time
whose mean value can be selected with the length length of the DNA and the environment conditions \cite{}. Since the dye molecule is fixed at a certain point in space, with a fixed exciting intensity, we expect a fixed detected intensity. The main advantage of this experimental approach is that the hybridization is transient and after some time the DNA will de-hybridize, freeing the docking site for another imaging strand to come. As a result, photobleaching of the dye is not a limiting factor for the experiment, since \textit{the same point} in space can be probed several times with different single molecules.

 \begin{figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{transient_single_site_results}%
 \caption{\textbf{Fluorescence enhancement of single Cy5 molecules with transient binding.} (a) Binned intensity histogram. (b) Binned fluorescence time trace (bin time = 1 ms). From these two plots, two intensity levels are clearly recognized: the high level corresponds to the enhanced fluorescence signal of one Cy5 molecule at a fixed position in the hotspot while the low level corresponds to the intensity from gold nanorod luminescence plus the contribution of the un-enhanced molecules in the detection volume (free docking-strand, shown in the inset on the right).
(c) Interphoton delay probability density function (PDF) obtained from the TTTR measurements (empty dots) and a biexponential fit, one for each intensity level. The retrieved intensities from this fit are shown in green dashed lines in (a) and (b), which coincide with the high and low levels.
\label{fg:transient_results}}
 \end{figure}



Figure \ref{fg:transient_results} shows the experimental results on our two-intensity system. On plot (a), at the top left, we show the typical characterization of the fluorescence time traces, a binned time trace which shows the evolution in time of the number of counts and on the right the histogram of binned intensity. Two levels can be clearly identify, the high-fluorescence level corresponds to the inset in (a), the DNA docking strand and imaging strand are hybridized and a dye molecule is kept at a fixed position in the hotspot, thus emitting enhanced fluorescence. After some seconds the DNA de-hybridizes and the imaging strand leaves the hot-spot, thus the signal goes down. 
The low level signal can be attributed to the luminescence of the gold nanorod and of the unenhanced molecules in the confocal volume. 
For our purpose here, we have a detected stream of photons coming from two well-defined intensity levels. 
We would like to retrieve these two levels using the interphoton delay distribution by fitting a biexponential function. 
Figure \ref{fg:transient_results} (c) shows the experimental curve and the fitting, from which we extracted the intensity levels marked in (a) and (b) with dashed lines. These levels clearly reproduce the levels evidenced by the binned time trace and intensity histograms, but they were obtained without the need of any arbitrary parameter. In the supplementary material we show how the binned plots change dramatically with the binning time. 


The results in this simple case show how useful this type of analysis can be, since we were able to extract information from our TTTR data without introducing any arbitrary parameter.


\section{Gaussian beam in two dimensions\label{sec:gaussian2d}}

A more realistic scenario to use our analysis is the problem of two dimensional diffusion of fluorescent molecules around a Gaussian beam, described by an intensity function $I(\ve{r}) = I_0 \exp[-r^2/\sigma^2]$, where $(r,\theta)$ are the normal polar coordinates in the plane and $\sigma$ represents the waist of the beam. 
In this case, the intensity profile is bi-dimensional and only depends on the distance to the center of the beam and we take a concentration $C$ of fluorescent molecules per unit area. Using this intensity distribution in equation \ref{eq:result} we calculate the expected interphoton delay distribution $p_G(\tau)$and find the integral form

\begin{equation}
p_{G}(\tau)=-\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d}\tau}\left[ \exp\left(-C \sigma_0^2 \pi \int_{\epsilon}^1\left(1-\exp\left[-\tau I_0 u \right]\right) \frac{\mbox{d}u}{u}\right)    \right]\,,  
\label{eq:gaussian2d}
\end{equation}
where we defined $\epsilon \equiv \exp\left(-\frac{R^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$ and $R$ is the maximum radius accessible by the diffusing molecules.

We studied this case experimentally in a regular confocal microscope by confining the diffusion of ATTO647N dye molecules in a lipid bi-layer, obtaining a bi-dimensional case and a reduced diffusion coefficient of $D=4.4\, \mu$m$^2$s$^{-1}$, as presented previously. \cite{Pradhan2016} 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{2D_gaussian_with_single}%
\caption{\textbf{Bidimensional molecular diffusion probed with a Gaussian beam.} (a) Interphoton delay probability density function (PDF) for the case of high concentration of molecules, with an average

(corresponding to $\approx 14$ and $225$ molecules per $\mu$m$^2$, respectively). 
The circles with error bars are experimental values while the green solid line is

of molecules, $<N>=0.5$ ($\approx 0.9$ molecules per $\mu$m$^2$). In this case we find some deviations
from the theory. 
\label{fg:gaussian2d}}
\end{figure}

We performed the experiment for high and low concentrations of molecules in the lipid bi-layer and fitted 
the experimental interphoton curves with $p_{G}(\tau)$ from equation \ref{eq:gaussian2d} using the 
experimental value for the beam waist, $\omega_0=292$ nm. 
Figure \ref{fg:gaussian2d} shows the experimentally obtained interphoton delay probability density function for high (a) and low (b) concentrations along with the corresponding fits using our theoretical result. 
In the case of high concentration the model reproduces the results quite well while for the low concentration it does not. This is a direct consequence of the main approximation in our model, that neglects the effect of diffusion, which can be applied for the case of many molecules in the Gaussian focal spot but fails in the case of low number of molecules. The deviations found could be used to study diffusion. We also note that the higher the number of molecules, the more exponential
the curve looks. This is consistent with the limit of extremely high number of molecules, discussed in the appendix. 
% BIS: be careful, remove this last line


\section{Model for the enhancement in two dimensions}

We now turn to the case of plasmonic enhancement. We first use present a semi-analytical approach with simple 
intensity distributions that mimic the complicated process of fluorescence enhancement by metallic nanoparticles to 
gain some intuition on the behavior of the impact that these effect has in the interphoton delay distribution.
The simple model we take for the near-field intensity distribution is the sum of a Gaussian beam
and a radial power law with exponent $\alpha$: 
\begin{equation}
I(r) = W_0 \left[ \exp \left(-\frac{r^2}{\sigma^2} \right) + E \left(\frac{R_{NP}}{r}\right)^\alpha  \right]\,, 
\quad r \leq R_\textrm{NP}
\label{eq:enhancement_model}
\end{equation}
where $W_0$ is the unenhanced intensity, $\sigma$ the width of the Gaussian illumination, $E$ the enhancement
factor and $R_\textrm{NP}$ the nanoparticle radius. 
We note that the Gaussian case studied in the previous section is re-obtained for $R_\textrm{NP}=0$. Figure
\ref{fg:enahncement_model} (a) shows the comparison of this intensity distribution for two different values 
of the exponent $\alpha$ with the unenhaced case. 
With this intensity spatial distribution we calculated the interphoton delay distribution by numerically 
solving the integral in \ref{eq:result}. Note that the area inside the nanoparticle is not accessible
to the molecules so the integration was carried from $r=R_\textrm{NP}$.
The obtained distributions are shown in figure \ref{fg:enahncement_model} (b) 
for a $10$ molecules in the Gaussian area.  Clearly the distributions with enhancement show a more peaked feature at
extremely short interphoton times due to the high rate emission created when a molecule enters the 
enhanced intensity area in the near-field. 

In order to quantitatively compare the interphoton delay distributions for the different cases we decided to 
fit the curve with a stretched exponential, i.e. we use the function
\begin{equation}
f(\tau) = A \exp\left( \lambda \tau^\beta\right)
\label{eq:strechted_exp}
\end{equation}
to approximate the complicated behavior of the interphoton delay distribution. This works reasonably for short 
times and fails to reproduce the tails in the curves. Nevertheless, we focus our analysis in the short times
which contain the information of the enhancement. We fit the calculated PDFs for different concentrations of molecules
ranging from the situation of a very diluted sample ($10^{-2}$ molecules in the Gaussian area given by $\pi \sigma^2$) to an extremely high number of molecules ($10^{6}$). Figure \ref{fg:enahncement_model} (c) shows the obtained exponent for
different concentrations for the three cases mentioned. In the Gaussian case we approximate to the exponential case
$\beta=1$ for $<N>=100$ while for the enhanced case we need 3 orders of magnitude higher concentration. This is
in agreement with the fact that the ratio of the near field area $A_\textrm{NF}$
(consider as the volume that contains intensities highers than $EW_0\exp(-1)$) to the far field $A_\textrm{FF}=\pi\sigma^2$ is $\frac{A_\textrm{NF}}{A_\textrm{FF}} \sim 10^{-3}$. In other words, to obtain an 
exponential-like interphoton delay distribution we need to completely fill with molecules the near field area.

\section{Conclusions}

To conclude, we showed ...

Interphoton delay distribution is an useful tool to characterize a stream of photons, specifically when there is enhancement.
We show this fact by controlling the position of single fluorescent molecules using transient binding.

We presented an analytical model to obtain the interphoton delay distribution from the
intensity distribution in the case of slowly diffusing molecules.  

We used this model for the 2d diffusion in a Gaussian illumination profile. good approximation with high enough concentration.

present a toy model to relate the fit of the distribution to the number of molecules in the case of gaussian and 
enhancement.
