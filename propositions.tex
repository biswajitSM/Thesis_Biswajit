\begin{enumerate}
	\item The shortened lifetimes in fluorescence-enhancements experiments using plasmonics are primarily due to nonradiative losses to the metal surfaces.
	\refp{Chapter 2 and 3 of this thesis}
	
	\item Kinetic studies of biomolecular processes by plasmonic sensing require partial or full immobilization. 
	\refp{Chapter 2 and 3 of this thesis}
	
	\item Interphoton time-delay is an overlooked parameter in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy.
	\refp{Chapter 4 of this thesis}
	
	\item Histogram of bright and dark times of a single-molecule-fluorescence time trace can hide rare events.
	\refp{Chapter 5 of this thesis}
	
	\item Immobilization processes can alter catalytic activities of enzymes.
	\refp{Francesco Secundo, Chem. Soc. Rev.,42 , 6250-6261(2013)}
	
	\item Magnitude of fluorescence enhancement by plasmonics should always be mentioned with the quantum yield of the fluorophore.

	% \item Contrary to what is reported by Yang et al., orientation rather than distance between donor and acceptor could be the main reason for variation in the electron transfer rates in flavin reductase.
	\item Orientation could be the major reason for variation in the electron transfer rate in single proteins rather than distance between donor and acceptor, contrary to Yang et al.'s report.	
	\refp{Yang et al. Science 302, 262-266 (2003)}
	
	\item The term `protein dynamics' has a vague meaning and is often a source of confusion. Specific terms should be defined to categorize the fluctuations in different length and time scales.
	\refp{Kern et al. Nature 450, 964â€“972 (2007)}
	
	% \item To some extent, humans are responsible for the frequently occurring current natural disasters.
	\item `Data available on request' is equivalent to `data inaccessible'.
	% \item The Netherlands does not have mountains.

	\item Dreams are no different than realities.
