I was born on 15th July 1991 in Odisha, India.
In 2011, I obtained my bachelor degree from Utkal University (Odisha) with Physics and Chemistry as major subjects.
Then I moved to Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai where I completed MSc in Chemistry in August 2013.
During my masters, I investigated the microscopic arrangement of lipid molecules in micelles of different shapes with the help of ultrafast fluorescence techniques.
From November 2013 to January 2014, I worked as a guest researcher in Leiden University in the group of Prof.~Michel Orrit and Prof.~Gerard Canters.
During this short stay, I learned how to synthesize proteins from cells and label them with fluorescent markers.
In February 2014, I started my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Michel Orrit and Prof. Gerard Canters.
During my PhD I studied fluorescence enhancement by a gold nanorod and single-molecule dynamics of electron-transfer proteins.
The outputs of my PhD are reported in this thesis.
During my PhD, I supervised three undergraduate students and assisted a course on Molecular Physics for undergraduates.


% After my PhD, I wish to continue doing science in the form of research and/or teaching.
