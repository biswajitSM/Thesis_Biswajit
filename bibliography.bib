  abstract = {Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the atomic scale. These atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 106 enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.}

 metallic nanoparticle are positioned with nanometer
 precision. The single-molecule spectroscopy method employed
 here reports on the co-localization of particle and dye,
 while fluorescence lifetime imaging is used to directly
 obtain the correlation of intensity and fluorescence
 lifetime for varying particle to dye distances. Our data
 can be well explained by exact calculations that include
 dipole-dipole orientation and distances. Fitting with a
 more practical model for nanosurface energy transfer yields
 10.4 nm as the characteristic distance of 50% energy
 transfer. The use of DNA nanotechnology together with
 minimal sample usage by attaching the particles to the DNA
 origami directly on the microscope coverslip paves the way
 for more complex experiments exploiting dye-nanoparticle
 interactions.},

 these competing effects, previous experiments showed either

  Abstract                 = {NAD is a key determinant of cellular energy metabolism. In
 contrast, its phosphorylated form, NADP, plays a central
 role in biosynthetic pathways and antioxidant defence. The
 reduced forms of both pyridine nucleotides are fluorescent
 in living cells but they cannot be distinguished, as they
 are spectrally identical. Here, using genetic and
 pharmacological approaches to perturb NAD(P)H metabolism,
 we find that fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)
 differentiates quantitatively between the two cofactors.
 Systematic manipulations to change the balance between
 oxidative and glycolytic metabolism suggest that these
 states do not directly impact NAD(P)H fluorescence decay
 rates. The lifetime changes observed in cancers thus likely
 reflect shifts in the NADPH/NADH balance. Using a
 mathematical model, we use these experimental data to
 quantify the relative levels of NADH and NADPH in different
 cell types of a complex tissue, the mammalian cochlea. This
 reveals NADPH-enriched populations of cells, raising
 questions about their distinct metabolic roles.},

  Abstract                 = {A photon interacts efficiently with an atom when its
 frequency corresponds exactly to the energy between two
 eigenstates. But at the nanoscale, homogeneous and
 inhomogeneous broadenings strongly hinder the ability of
 solid-state systems to absorb, scatter or emit light. By
 compensating the impedance mismatch between visible
 wavelengths and nanometre-sized objects, optical antennas
 can enhance light–matter interactions over a broad
 frequency range. Here we use a DNA template to introduce a
 single dye molecule in gold particle dimers that act as
 antennas for light with spontaneous emission rates enhanced
 by up to two orders of magnitude and single photon emission
 statistics. Quantitative agreement between measured rate
 enhancements and theoretical calculations indicate a
 nanometre control over the emitter-particle position while
 10 billion copies of the target geometry are synthesized in
 parallel. Optical antennas can thus tune efficiently the
 photo-physical properties of nano-objects by precisely
 engineering their electromagnetic environment.},

 that Trolox acts in accordance with a mechanism that
 involves triplet quenching through electron transfer and
 subsequent recovery of the resulting radical ion by the
 complementary redox reaction. The required oxidant for this
 unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system
 (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular
 oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a
 quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing
 properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting
 results regarding the action of antifading agents and might
 lead to a common mechanistic understanding of
 photobleaching and its prevention. Finally, a recipe on the
 proper use of Trolox as an antifading agent is provided.},

 The intensities of the CD and MCD bands are consistent with

 the near-infrared spectroscopic results suggest that the

 constants and diffusion coefficients by measuring the rates
 of decay of spontaneous concentration fluctuations. The
 equilibrium of the system is not disturbed during the
 measurement. We measure the number of molecules of a
 specified type in a defined open volume as a function of
 time and compute the time course of the deviations from the
 thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on
 the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous
 microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same
 phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic
 departures from equilibrium which result from external
 perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields
 the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients
 as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the
 number of the specified molecules is measured by a property
 such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and
 sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined
 by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules
 appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to
 diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration
 fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the
 intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents
 the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and
 diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light
 intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of
 general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical
 reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand
 to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a
 unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially
 useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively
 noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely
 spaced in free energy, small systems, and systems not
 readily subject to perturbations of state.},

 time traces of enzymatic turnovers for individual
 beta-galactosidase molecules by detecting one fluorescent
 product at a time. A molecular memory phenomenon arises at
 high substrate concentrations, characterized by clusters of
 turnover events separated by periods of low activity. Such
 memory lasts for decades of timescales ranging from
 milliseconds to seconds owing to the presence of
 interconverting conformers with broadly distributed
 lifetimes. We proved that the Michaelis-Menten equation
 still holds even for a fluctuating single enzyme, but bears

 conditions the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron
 transport was found to be directly proportional to the
 product of the photochemical fluorescence quenching (qQ)
 and the efficiency of excitation capture by open
 Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centres (Fv/Fm). A simple
 fluorescence parameter, ΔφF/φFm, which is defined by the
 difference in fluorescence yield at maximal φFm, and
 steady-state φFs, divided by φFm, can be used routinely
 to estimate changes in the quantum yield of non-cyclic
 electron transport. It is demonstrated that both the
 concentration of open PS II reaction centres and the
 efficiency of excitation capture by these centres will
 determine the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron
 transport in vivo and that deactivation of excitation
 within PS II complexes by non-photochemical processes must
 influence the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron
 transport.},

 ideal to concentrate optical fields at a nanoscale fully

 resonant aluminum nanogap antenna tailored to enhance
 single molecule FRET. A 20 nm gap confines light into a

 of the donor-acceptor distance, a large 10-fold increase in
 the local density of optical states, and strong intensity
 enhancement. With our dedicated design, we obtain 20-fold
 enhancement on the fluorescence emission of donor and
 acceptor dyes, and most importantly up to 5-fold
 enhancement of the FRET rate for donor-acceptor separations
 of 10 nm. We also provide a thorough framework of the
 fluorescence photophysics occurring in the nanoscale gap
 volume. The presented enhancement of energy transfer flow

 delivery are gaining popularity for cancer treatment. To
 improve therapeutic selectivity, one important strategy is
 to remotely trigger the release of a therapeutic cargo from
 a specially designed gene- or drug-laden near-infrared

 While there have been multiple demonstrations of NIR
 nanoparticle-based release platforms, our understanding of
 how light-triggered release works in such complexes is
 still limited. Here, we investigate the specific mechanisms
 of DNA release from plasmonic nanoparticle complexes using
 continuous wave (CW) and femtosecond pulsed lasers. We find
 that the characteristics of nanoparticle-based DNA release
 vary profoundly from the same nanoparticle complex,
 depending on the type of laser excitation. CW laser
 illumination drives the photothermal release of
 dehybridized single-stranded DNA, while pulsed-laser
 excitation results in double-stranded DNA release by
 cleavage of the Au–S bond, with negligible local heating.
 This dramatic difference in DNA release from the same
 DNA–nanoparticle complex has very important implications
 in the development of NIR-triggered gene or drug delivery

This work has shown that protein reorganization energies are sensitive to the medium surrounding the redox sites and that an aqueous environment, in particular, leads to large reorganization energies. Analyses of electronic-coupling strengths suggest that the efficiency of long-range ET depends on the protein secondary structure: β sheets appear to mediate coupling more efficiently than α-helical structures, and hydrogen bonds play a critical role in both.},

 from Streptomyces coelicolor was investigated by structural
 (XRD), spectroscopic (optical, EPR), and kinetics
 (stopped-flow) experiments on variants in which residue
 Tyr108 had been replaced by Phe or Ala through
 site-directed mutagenesis. Contrary to the more common
 three-domain MCOs, a tyrosine in the two-domain SLAC is
 found to participate in the enzyme mechanism by providing
 an electron during oxygen reduction, giving rise to the
 temporary appearance of a tyrosyl radical. The relatively
 low k(cat)/K(M) of SLAC and the involvement of Y108 in the
 enzyme mechanism may reflect an adaptation to a milieu in
 which there is an imbalance between the available reducing
 and oxidizing co-substrates. The purported evolutionary
 relationship between the two-domain MCOs and human
 ceruloplasmin appears to extend not only to the 3D
 structure and the mode of binding of the Cu's in the
 trinuclear center, as noted before, but also to the enzyme
 mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = { Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are often used as colloidal
 carriers in numerous applications owing to their low-cost
 and size-controlled preparation as well as their
 straightforward surface functionalization with thiol
 containing molecules forming self-assembling monolayers
 (SAM). The quantification of the ligand density of such
 modified GNPs is technically challenging, yet of utmost
 importance for quality control in many applications. In
 this contribution, a new method for the determination of
 the surface coverage of GNPs with thiol containing ligands
 is proposed. It makes use of the measurement of the
 gold-to-sulfur (Au/S) ratio by inductively coupled plasma
 mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) and its dependence on the
 nanoparticle diameter. The simultaneous ICP–MS
 measurement of gold and sulfur was carefully validated and
 found to be a robust method with a relative standard
 uncertainty of lower than 10%. A major advantage of this
 method is the independence from sample preparation; for
 example, sample loss during the washing steps is not
 affecting the results. To demonstrate the utility of the
 straightforward method, GNPs of different diameters were
 synthesized and derivatized on the surface with
 bifunctional (lipophilic) ω-mercapto-alkanoic acids and
 (hydrophilic) mercapto-poly(ethylene glycol)
 (PEG)n-carboxylic acids, respectively, by self-assembling
 monolayer (SAM) formation. Thereby, a size-independent but
 ligand-chain length-dependent ligand density was found. The
 surface coverage increases from 4.3 to 6.3 molecules nm–2
 with a decrease of ligand chain length from 3.52 to 0.68
 nm. Furthermore, no significant difference between the
 surface coverage of hydrophilic and lipophilic ligands with
 approximately the same ligand length was found, indicating
 that sterical hindrance is of more importance than, for
 example, intermolecular strand interactions of Van der
 Waals forces as claimed in other studies.},

 reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical
 astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions
 of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy.
 Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes
 enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and
 thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the
 sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image
 resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions
 and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This
 development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of
 nanoscopic cellular structures.},

 with a spectral ratio (A625/A280) less than 0.01 could be
 separated from holo-azurin with a spectral ratio of 0.58
 (+/- 0.01). The properties of azurin* were examined by
 electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE and IEF) and spectroscopic
 (UV/vis, 1H-NMR, static and dynamic fluorescence)
 techniques, and compared to the properties of holo-azurin
 and apo-azurin. Azurin* resembles apo-azurin (same pKa*
 values of His-35 and His-117, same fluorescence
 characteristics). However, it has lost the ability to bind
 Cu-ions. It is tentatively concluded that azurin* is a
 chemically modified form of azurin, the modification
 possibly being due to oxidation of the ligand residue
 Cys-112 or the formation of a chemical bond between the
 ligand residues Cys-112 and His-117. In agreement with
 previous results from Hutnik and Szabo (Biochemistry (1989)
 28, 3923-3934), fluorescence experiments show that the
 heterogeneous fluorescence decay observed for holo-azurin
 is not due to the presence of azurin*, but most likely
 originates from conformational heterogeneity of the
 holo-azurin.},

 explore the role of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on

 fluorescence enhancements as literature reports on
 lithographically fabricated nanoparticle assemblies. The
 fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be
 enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its
 SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement
 results from both an excitation rate enhancement of
 &#x223C;130 and an effective emission enhancement of
 &#x223C;9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases
 sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the
 excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a
 partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the
 fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence
 enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are
 consistent with numerical simulations.},

 be overcome by using a plasmonic nanoantenna which confines
 the electric field of excitation light into a tiny volume
 near its surface and thereby reduces the effective
 excitation volume by several orders of magnitude. Here we
 demonstrate successful FCS measurements on a 1 μM solution
 of crystal violet (CV) dye in glycerol using a gold nanorod
 antenna. Our correlation analysis yields two components:
 (i) a slow component with correlation time of about 100 ms,
 which is attributed to sticking and bleaching of the dye,
 and (ii) a fast component of about 1 ms, which could arise
 from dye diffusion through the near-field of the nanorod

 objects such as single molecules, it is important to be
 able to control light–molecule interactions1, 2, 3, 4.
 Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields
 when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman
 scattering5, but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs
 depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal
 tips6 and colloids7, 8 can enhance fluorescence, the highly
 enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated
 bowtie nanoantennas9 provide a structure that is more
 controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold
 bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's
 fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than
 reported previously7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that
 this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an
 increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement
 of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor
 of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects.
 Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for
 high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper summarizes our present theoretical
 understanding of single-molecule kinetics associated with
 the Michaelis−Menten mechanism of enzymatic reactions.
 Single-molecule enzymatic turnover experiments typically
 measure the probability density f(t) of the stochastic
 waiting time t for individual turnovers. While f(t) can be
 reconciled with ensemble kinetics, it contains more
 information than the ensemble data; in particular, it
 provides crucial information on dynamic disorder, the
 apparent fluctuation of the catalytic rates due to the
 interconversion among the enzyme's conformers with
 different catalytic rate constants. In the presence of
 dynamic disorder, f(t) exhibits a highly stretched
 multiexponential decay at high substrate concentrations and
 a monoexponential decay at low substrate concentrations. We
 derive a single-molecule Michaelis−Menten equation for
 the reciprocal of the first moment of f(t), 1/〈t〉,
 which shows a hyperbolic dependence on the substrate
 concentration [S], similar to the ensemble enzymatic
 velocity. We prove that this single-molecule
 Michaelis−Menten equation holds under many conditions, in
 particular when the intercoversion rates among different
 enzyme conformers are slower than the catalytic rate.
 However, unlike the conventional interpretation, the
 apparent catalytic rate constant and the apparent Michaelis
 constant in this single-molecule Michaelis−Menten
 equation are complicated functions of the catalytic rate
 constants of individual conformers. We also suggest that
 the randomness parameter r, defined as 〈(t −
 〈t〉)2〉/〈t〉2, can serve as an indicator for
 dynamic disorder in the catalytic step of the enzymatic
 reaction, as it becomes larger than unity at high substrate
 concentrations in the presence of dynamic disorder.},

 the implementation of confocal microscopy FCS. Since then,
 a flurry of experiments has implemented FCS to characterize
 the photochemistry of dyes, the translational and

 to monitor conformational fluctuations of green fluorescent
 proteins and DNA molecules. In this review, we present the
 analytical formalism of an FCS measurement, as well as
 practical considerations for the design of an FCS setup and

 in analytical chemistry, biophysics and cell biology,
 specifically emphasizing the advantages and pitfalls of the

 also discuss recent extensions of FCS in single-molecule

  Abstract                 = {Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and
 complex optical properties. Examples include the intense
 colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance
 absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited
 fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the
 interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and
 surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased
 fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on
 fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain
 directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal
 films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to
 predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a
 colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or
 enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how
 the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained
 using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs).
 The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is
 simple to understand. According to the RP model, the
 emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can
 be predicted from the optical properties of the metal
 structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory,
 and/or Maxwell’s equations. For example, according to Mie
 theory and the size and shape of the particle, the
 extinction of metal colloids can be due to either
 absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by
 absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering.
 Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench
 fluorescence because absorption is dominant over
 scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance
 fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant
 over absorption. The ability of a metal’s surface to
 absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching
 requirements at the metal–sample interface. Wavenumber
 matching considerations can also be used to predict whether
 fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar
 surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations
 suggest that the so called “lossy surface waves” which
 quench fluorescence are due to induced electron
 oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because
 wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the
 energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy
 surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of
 the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model
 provides a rational approach for designing
 fluorophore–metal configurations with the desired
 emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic
 fluorophore technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool
 in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has
 also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in
 medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date
 all the fluorescence observables, including spectral
 shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have
 all been utilized in basic and applied uses of
 fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a
 new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay
 engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of
 fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing
 their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence
 experiments the radiative rates are not changed because
 these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the
 fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by
 quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental
 effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in
 the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or
 resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the
 emission by providing additional routes for decay of the
 excited states without emission. In contrast to the
 relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is
 known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing
 the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic
 surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from
 the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of
 metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or
 decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of
 low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes,
 and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific
 directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the
 emitted photons, but rather as the result of the
 fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the
 metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal
 and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the
 unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative
 rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical
 fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can
 result in an effective increase in photostability.
 Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the
 local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict
 that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near
 particles can result in usefully high emission from
 “nonfluorescent” molecules and million-fold increases
 in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore.
 We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing
 and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby
 metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic
 quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA
 detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced
 fluorescence.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a new fluorescence imaging methodology in
 which the image contrast is derived from the fluorescence
 lifetime at each point in a two-dimensional image and not
 the local concentration and/or intensity of the
 fluorophore. In the present apparatus, lifetime images are
 created from a series of images obtained with a
 gain-modulated image intensifier. The frequency of gain
 modulation is at the light-modulation frequency (or a
 harmonic thereof), resulting in homodyne phase-sensitive
 images. These stationary phase-sensitive images are
 collected using a slow-scan CCD camera. A series of such
 images, obtained with various phase shifts of the
 gain-modulation signal, is used to determine the phase
 angle and/or modulation of the emission at each pixel,
 which is in essence the phase or modulation lifetime image.
 An advantage of this method is that pixel-to-pixel scanning
 is not required to obtain the images, as the information
 from all pixels is obtained at the same time. The method
 has been experimentally verified by creating lifetime
 images of standard fluorophores with known lifetimes,
 ranging from 1 to 10 ns. As an example of biochemical
 imaging we created lifetime images of Yt-base when quenched
 by acrylamide, as a model for a fluorophore in distinct
 environments that affect its decay time. Additionally, we
 describe a faster imaging procedure that allows images in
 which a specific decay time is suppressed to be calculated,
 allowing rapid visualization of unique features and/or
 regions with distinct decay times. The concepts and
 methodologies of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) have
 numerous potential applications in the biosciences.
 Fluorescence lifetimes are known to be sensitive to
 numerous chemical and physical factors such as pH, oxygen,
 temperature, cations, polarity, and binding to
 macromolecules. Hence the FLIM method allows chemical or
 physical imaging of macroscopic and microscopic samples.},

  abstract = {We present a novel blurring-free stencil lithography patterning technique for high-throughput fabrication of large-scale arrays of nanoaperture optical antennas. The approach relies on dry etching through nanostencils to achieve reproducible and uniform control of nanoantenna geometries at the nanoscale, over millimeter-sizes in a thin aluminum film. We demonstrate the fabrication of over 400 000 bowtie nanoaperture (BNA) antennas on biocompatible substrates, having gap sizes ranging from (80 &#xB1; 5) nm down to (20 &#xB1; 10) nm. To validate their applicability on live cell research, we used the antenna substrates as hotspots of localized illumination to excite fluorescently labeled lipids on living cell membranes. The high signal-to-background afforded by the BNA arrays allowed the recording of single fluorescent bursts corresponding to the passage of freely diffusing individual lipids through hotspot excitation regions as small as 20 nm. Statistical analysis of burst length and intensity together with simulations demonstrate that the measured signals arise from the ultraconfined excitation region of the antennas. Because these inexpensive antenna arrays are fully biocompatible and amenable to their integration in most fluorescence microscopes, we foresee a large number of applications including the investigation of the plasma membrane of living cells with nanoscale resolution at endogenous expression levels.}

The importance of two-focus FCS is that a calibrated distance between foci provides an intrinsic calibration to derive diffusion constants from measured correlation times. Through electromagnetic modelling we analyze a geometry of perpendicular nanorods, and their inverse, i.e., nanoslits. While we find that nanorods are not suited for nano-antenna enhanced 2fFCS due to substantial background signal, a nanoslit geometry is expected to provide a di tinct cross-correlation between orthogonally polarized detection channels. Furthermore, by utilizing a periodic array of nanoslits instead of a single pair, the amplitude of the cross-correlation can be enhanced. To demonstrate this technique, we present a proof of principle experiment on the basis of a periodic array of nanoslits, applied to lipid diffusion in a supported lipid bilayer.}

 domains of 50–700nm in diameter are located in the
 exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Most of these
 domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and
 proteins, and are believed to coordinate signal
 transduction cascades. Whether similar domains are also
 present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane
 is unclear so far. To investigate the presence of
 cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting
 sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow
 fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence
 microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing
 in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were
 recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of
 individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent
 protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales
 from 5 to 200ms. The results show that the diffusion of
 30–40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a
 typical size of 200nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor
 cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics
 significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not
 be related to the membrane domains identified so far.},

 molecules were observed in real time by monitoring the
 emission from the enzyme's fluorescent active site, flavin
 adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Statistical analyses of
 single-molecule trajectories revealed a significant and
 slow fluctuation in the rate of cholesterol oxidation by
 FAD. The static disorder and dynamic disorder of reaction
 rates, which are essentially indistinguishable in
 ensemble-averaged experiments, were determined separately
 by the real-time single-molecule approach. A molecular
 memory phenomenon, in which an enzymatic turnover was not
 independent of its previous turnovers because of a slow
 fluctuation of protein conformation, was evidenced by
 spontaneous spectral fluctuation of FAD.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand better the effect of electrostatics on the
 rigidity of the DNA double helix, we define DNA*, the null
 isomer of DNA, as the hypothetical structure that would
 result from DNA if its phosphate groups were not ionized.
 For the purposes of theoretical analysis, we model DNA* as
 identical to ordinary DNA but supplemented by a
 longitudinal compression force equal in magnitude but
 oppositely directed to the stretching (tension) force on
 DNA caused by phosphate-phosphate repulsions. The null
 isomer DNA* then becomes an elastically buckled form of
 fully ionized DNA. On this basis, we derive a nonadditive
 relationship between the persistence length P of DNA and
 the persistence length P* of its null isomer. From the
 formula obtained we can predict the value of P* if P is
 known, and we can predict the ionic strength dependence of
 P under the assumption that P* does not depend on ionic
 strength. We predict a value of P* for null DNA drastically
 lower than the value of P for DNA in its ordinary state of
 fully ionized phosphates. The predicted dependence of P on
 salt concentration is log-c over most of the concentration
 range, with no tendency toward a salt-independent value in
 the range of validity of the theory. The predictions are
 consistent with much of the persistence-length data
 available for DNA. Alternate theories of the
 Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman type, including one by the author, are
 considered skeptically on the grounds that the underlying
 model may not be realistic. Specifically, we doubt the
 accuracy for real polyelectrolytes of the
 Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman assumption that the polymer structure
 is invariant to changes in electrostatic forces.},

 explored plasmonic enhancement, so far with moderate

 enhance the radiative decay rates of monoexcitons and

 ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon
 absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method
 has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated
 growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The
 disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e.,
 formation of noncylindrical NRs, φ-shaped particles, and
 formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have
 been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium
 bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one.
 In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content

  Abstract                 = {Optical antennas are devices that convert freely
 propagating optical radiation into localized energy, and
 vice versa. They enable the control and manipulation of
 optical fields at the nanometre scale, and hold promise for
 enhancing the performance and efficiency of photodetection,
 light emission and sensing. Although many of the properties
 and parameters of optical antennas are similar to their
 radiowave and microwave counterparts, they have important
 differences resulting from their small size and the
 resonant properties of metal nanostructures. This Review
 summarizes the physical properties of optical antennas,
 provides a summary of some of the most important recent
 developments in the field, discusses the potential
 applications and identifies the future challenges and
 opportunities.},

  Abstract                 = {In most electronic imaging applications, images with high
 resolution (HR) are desired and often required. HR means
 that pixel density within an image is high, and therefore
 an HR image can offer more details that may be critical in
 various applications. For example, HR medical images are
 very helpful for a doctor to make a correct diagnosis. It
 may be easy to distinguish an object from similar ones
 using HR satellite images, and the performance of pattern
 recognition in computer vision can be improved if an HR
 image is provided. Since the 1970s, charge-coupled device
 (CCD) and CMOS image sensors have been widely used to
 capture digital images. Although these sensors are suitable
 for most imaging applications, the current resolution level
 and consumer price will not satisfy the future demand. For
 example, people want an inexpensive HR digital
 camera/camcorder or see the price gradually reduce, and
 scientists often need a very HR level close to that of an
 analog 35 mm film that has no visible artifacts when an
 image is magnified. Thus, finding a way to increase the
 current resolution level is needed.},

 spectral characteristics redox profiles can be directly
 imaged by means of far-field fluorescence. At suitable
 levels of dilution, on optically transparent electrode
 surfaces, reversible interfacial electron transfer
 processes can be followed pixel by pixel down to scales
 which approach the molecular. In mapping out switching
 potentials across a surface population, thermodynamic
 dispersion, related to variance in the orientation,
 electronic coupling, protein fold, electric field drop, and
 general surface order, can be quantified. The
 self-assembled monolayer buffering the protein from the
 underlying metallic electrode surface not only acts to tune
 electronic coupling between the two but also potentially
 provides a variable more easily segmented from other
 contributions to molecular dispersion. We have,
 specifically, considered the possibility that the
 supporting monolayer crystallinity is a significant
 contributor to the subsequently observed spread in
 half-wave potentials. We report here that this is indeed
 the case and that this spread diminishes from 17 to 12 mV
 for the blue copper protein azurin as the supporting
 alkanethiol layer crystallinity increases. The work herein,
 then, presents not only a direct determination of
 submonolayer scale variance in redox character but also a
 means of tuning this through gross surface and entirely
 standard chemical means.},

 emission rate, with potential applications in sensing,
 integrated photonics and solar energy conversion.
 Significant increases in emission rate require an optical
 resonator that stores light in as small a volume as
 possible, for as long as possible. This is currently
 achieved using two main systems: photonic crystal
 microcavities and plasmonic metal nanoparticles. These two
 systems have largely been developed independently, but the
 underlying physical mechanisms are the same. Comparing the
 two provides insight into emission modification and
 illustrates some of the subtleties involved in interpreting
 experimental results.},

 a number of applications, including DNA sequencing4, 5,

 Unfortunately, observation of single molecules by
 diffraction-limited optics is restricted to detection
 volumes in the femtolitre range and requires pico- or
 nanomolar concentrations, far below the micromolar range
 where most biological reactions occur2. This limitation can
 be overcome using plasmonic nanostructures, which enable
 the confinement of light down to nanoscale volumes9, 10,
 11, 12, 13. Although these nanoantennas enhance
 fluorescence brightness14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, large
 background signals20, 21, 22 and/or unspecific binding to
 the metallic surface23, 24, 25 have hampered the detection
 of individual fluorescent molecules in solution at high
 concentrations. Here we introduce a novel
 ‘antenna-in-box’ platform that is based on a
 gap-antenna inside a nanoaperture. This design combines
 fluorescent signal enhancement and background screening,
 offering high single-molecule sensitivity (fluorescence
 enhancement up to 1,100-fold and microsecond transit times)
 at micromolar sample concentrations and zeptolitre-range
 detection volumes. The antenna-in-box device can be
 optimized for single-molecule fluorescence studies at
 physiologically relevant concentrations, as we demonstrate
 using various biomolecules.},

  Abstract                 = {The ever-improving time and space resolution and molecular
 detection sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy offer
 unique opportunities to deepen our insights into the
 function of chemical and biological catalysts. Because
 single-molecule microscopy allows for counting the turnover
 events one by one, one can map the distribution of the
 catalytic activities of different sites in solid
 heterogeneous catalysts, or one can study time-dependent
 activity fluctuations of individual sites in enzymes or
 chemical catalysts. By experimentally monitoring
 individuals rather than populations, the origin of complex
 behavior, e.g., in kinetics or in deactivation processes,
 can be successfully elucidated. Recent progress of temporal
 and spatial resolution in single-molecule fluorescence
 microscopy is discussed in light of its impact on catalytic
 assays. Key concepts are illustrated regarding the use of
 fluorescent reporters in catalytic reactions. Future
 challenges comprising the integration of other techniques,
 such as diffraction, scanning probe, or vibrational methods
 in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are
 suggested.},

 been achieved but has so far been restricted to molecules
 in the immobile state. Here we provide methodology for
 visualization of the motion of individual fluorescent
 molecules. It is applied to imaging of the diffusional path
 of single molecules in a phospholipid membrane by using
 phospholipids carrying one rhodamine dye molecule. For this
 methodology, fluorescence microscopy was carried to a
 sensitivity so that single fluorescent molecules
 illuminated for only 5 ms were resolvable at a signal/noise
 ratio of 28. Repeated illuminations permitted direct
 observation of the diffusional motion of individual
 molecules with a positional accuracy of 30 nm. Such
 capability has fascinating potentials in bioscience--for
 example, to correlate biological functions of cell
 membranes with movements, spatial organization, and
 stoichiometries of individual components.},

  Abstract                 = {Super-resolution techniques have begun to transform
 biological and biomedical research by allowing researchers
 to observe structures well below the classic diffraction
 limit of light. DNA points accumulation for imaging in
 nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) offers an
 easy-to-implement approach to localization-based
 super-resolution microscopy, owing to the use of DNA
 probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short
 dye-labeled ('imager') oligonucleotides to their
 complementary target ('docking') strands creates the
 necessary 'blinking' to enable stochastic super-resolution
 microscopy. Using the programmability and specificity of
 DNA molecules as imaging and labeling probes allows
 researchers to decouple blinking from dye photophysics,
 alleviating limitations of current super-resolution
 techniques, making them compatible with virtually any
 single-molecule-compatible dye. Recent developments in
 DNA-PAINT have enabled spectrally unlimited multiplexing,
 precise molecule counting and ultra-high, molecular-scale
 (sub-5-nm) spatial resolution, reaching ~1-nm localization
 precision. DNA-PAINT can be applied to a multitude of in
 vitro and cellular applications by linking docking strands
 to antibodies. Here, we present a protocol for the key
 aspects of the DNA-PAINT framework for both novice and
 expert users. This protocol describes the creation of DNA
 origami test samples, in situ sample preparation,
 multiplexed data acquisition, data simulation,
 super-resolution image reconstruction and post-processing
 such as drift correction, molecule counting (qPAINT) and
 particle averaging. Moreover, we provide an integrated
 software package, named Picasso, for the computational
 steps involved. The protocol is designed to be modular, so
 that individual components can be chosen and implemented
 per requirements of a specific application. The procedure
 can be completed in 1–2 d.},

  Abstract                 = {We combine interferometric detection of single gold
 nanoparticles, single molecule microscopy, and fluorescence
 lifetime measurement to study the modification of the
 fluorescence decay rate of an emitter close to a
 nanoparticle. In our experiment, gold particles with a
 diameter of 15 nm were attached to single dye molecules via
 double-stranded DNA of different lengths.
 Nanoparticle-induced lifetime modification (NPILM) has
 promise in serving as a nanoscopic ruler for the distance
 range well beyond 10 nm, which is the upper limit of
 fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore,
 the simultaneous detection of single nanoparticles and
 fluorescent molecules presented in this work provides new
 opportunities for single molecule biophysical studies.},

 Interpretations of the fluorescence responses obtained are
 provided, with consideration given to redox
 compartmentation and the formation of ethanol shortly after
 a glucose addition. An analytical spectrofluorophotometer
 was interfaced to a personal computer and adapted to
 measure fluorescence in a bioreactor. This was achieved by
 the use of quartz fiber-optic waveguides to convert the
 right-angle cuvette geometry of the analytical
 spectrofluorophotometer to an open-ended fluorescence probe
 geometry, resulting in a flexible culture fluorescence
 apparatus. Features of the apparatus include variable
 excitation and emission wavelengths, allowing for detection
 of NAD(P)H or flavin fluorescence, as well as small slit
 widths, a variable sampling rate, excitation and emission
 scanning capabilities, and good sensitivity.},

An accurate on/off-assignment is complicated by the intrinsic and extrinsic noise in every single-molecule fluorescence experiment. Using simulated data, the performance of the most widely employed binning and thresholding approach was systematically compared to change point analysis. It is shown that the underlying on- and off-histograms as well as the off-autocorrelation are not necessarily extracted from the "signal'' buried in noise. The shapes of the on- and off-histograms are affected by artifacts introduced by the analysis procedure and depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the overall fluorescence intensity. For experimental data where the background intensity is not constant over time we consider change point analysis to be more accurate. When using change point analysis for data of the enzyme α-chymotrypsin, no characteristics of dynamic disorder was found. In light of these results, dynamic disorder might not be a general sign of enzymatic reactions.},

 intrinsically fascinating and tremendously valuable.
 High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer
 unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate
 the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic
 function. GFP has become well established as a marker of

 by an in vivo approach with mutant strains of P. aeruginosa
 deficient in one or both of these electron-transfer
 proteins that cytochrome C551, but not azurin, is
 functional in this pathway. Expression studies demonstrated
 the presence of azurin in both aerobic and anaerobic
 cultures. A sharp increase in azurin expression was
 observed when cultures were shifted from exponential to
 stationary phase. The stationary-phase sigma factor, sigma
 s, was shown to be responsible for this induction. In
 addition, one of the two promoters transcribing the azu
 gene was regulated by the anaerobic transcriptional
 regulator ANR. An azurin-deficient mutant was more
 sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat than the
 wild-type P. aeruginosa. These results suggest a
 physiological role of azurin in stress situations like

 is applied recursively to an entire single molecule
 intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points.
 Expectation−maximization clustering and the Bayesian
 information criterion is then used for accurate
 determination of the true number of states accessible to
 the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative
 determination of intensity change points without the
 artificial time resolution limitations that arise from
 binning and thresholding.},

 making confocal imaging particularly applicable to incident

 with a confocal system in which scanning is performed by
 moving the light beam, rather than the stage. This system
 is considerably faster than the scanned stage microscope
 and is easy to use. We have found that confocal imaging
 gives greatly enhanced images of biological structures
 viewed with epifluorescence. The improvements are such that
 it is possible to optically section thick specimens with
 little degradation in the image quality of interior

In a flavin reductase, the fluorescence of flavin is quenched by a nearby tyrosine residue by means of photo-induced electron transfer. By probing the fluorescence lifetime of the single flavin on a photon-by-photon basis, we were able to observe the variation of flavin-tyrosine distance over time. We could then determine the potential of mean force between the flavin and the tyrosine, and a correlation analysis revealed conformational fluctuation at multiple time scales spanning from hundreds of microseconds to seconds. This phenomenon suggests the existence of multiple interconverting conformers related to the fluctuating catalytic reactivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can resolve
 the intrinsic fast-blinking kinetics (FBKs) of fluorescent
 molecules that occur on the order of microseconds. These
 FBKs can be heavily influenced by the microenvironments in
 which the fluorescent molecules are contained. In this
 work, FCS is used to monitor the dynamics of fluorescence
 emission from Cy5 labeled on DNA probes. We found that the
 FBKs of Cy5 can be tuned by having more or less unpaired
 guanines (upG) and thymines (upT) around the Cy5 dye. The
 observed FBKs of Cy5 are found to predominantly originate
 from the isomerization and back-isomerization processes of
 Cy5, and Cy5-nucleobase interactions are shown to slow down
 these processes. These findings lead to a more precise
 quantification of DNA hybridization using FCS analysis, in
 which the FBKs play a major role rather than the diffusion
 kinetics. We further show that the alterations of the FBKs
 of Cy5 on probe hybridization can be used to differentiate
 DNA targets with single-nucleotide differences. This
 discrimination relies on the design of a probe-target-probe
 DNA three-way-junction, whose basepairing configuration can
 be altered as a consequence of a single-nucleotide
 substitution on the target. Reconfiguration of the
 three-way-junction alters the Cy5-upG or Cy5-upT
 interactions, therefore resulting in a measurable change in
 Cy5 FBKs. Detection of single-nucleotide variations within
 a sequence selected from the Kras gene is carried out to
 validate the concept of this new method.},
