		  specified type in a defined open volume as a function of
		  time and compute the time course of the deviations from the
		  thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on
		  the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous
		  microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same
		  phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic
		  departures from equilibrium which result from external
		  perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields
		  the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients
		  as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the
		  number of the specified molecules is measured by a property
		  such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and
		  sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined
		  by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules
		  appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to
		  diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration
		  fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the
		  intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents
		  the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and
		  diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light
		  intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of
		  general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical
		  reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand
		  to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a
		  unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially
		  useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively
		  noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely
		  spaced in free energy, small systems, and systems not
		  readily subject to perturbations of state.},

		  the emission from gold nanorods of various aspect ratios in
		  the range between 2.25 (1.5 theory) and 6.0 (9 theory). The
		  calculation of the fluorescence spectra requires knowledge
		  of the nanorod size distribution, the enhancement factors,
		  and the shape of the unenhanced fluorescence spectrum. The
		  size distribution is determined from the fit of the
		  observed absorption spectrum for each value of aspect ratio
		  studied to the theoretical model of Gans. The theory by
		  Boyd and Shen is used for calculating the enhancement of
		  the fluorescence spectrum of the previously observed weak
		  emission of bulk gold, which originates from the interband
		  transition. This is carried out for nanorods of different
		  aspect ratios. To compare theory to the observed nanorod
		  fluorescence spectra, which suffer from self-absorption,
		  the calculated nanorod fluorescence spectra are corrected
		  for this effect using the observed absorption spectra. The
		  comparison between the observed and the calculated
		  fluorescence band shapes is found to be good. The
		  calculated changes in the relative intensities upon
		  changing the aspect ratios are found to be much greater
		  than that observed. This is due to the fact that for the
		  observed emission of all the nanorods studied nonradiative
		  processes dominate the relaxation mechanism of the excited
		  state, a fact that was not included in the theoretical
		  treatments.},

  abstract	= { Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are often used as colloidal
		  carriers in numerous applications owing to their low-cost
		  and size-controlled preparation as well as their
		  straightforward surface functionalization with thiol
		  containing molecules forming self-assembling monolayers
		  (SAM). The quantification of the ligand density of such
		  modified GNPs is technically challenging, yet of utmost
		  importance for quality control in many applications. In
		  this contribution, a new method for the determination of
		  the surface coverage of GNPs with thiol containing ligands
		  is proposed. It makes use of the measurement of the
		  gold-to-sulfur (Au/S) ratio by inductively coupled plasma
		  mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) and its dependence on the
		  nanoparticle diameter. The simultaneous ICP–MS
		  measurement of gold and sulfur was carefully validated and
		  found to be a robust method with a relative standard
		  uncertainty of lower than 10%. A major advantage of this
		  method is the independence from sample preparation; for
		  example, sample loss during the washing steps is not
		  affecting the results. To demonstrate the utility of the
		  straightforward method, GNPs of different diameters were
		  synthesized and derivatized on the surface with
		  bifunctional (lipophilic) ω-mercapto-alkanoic acids and
		  (hydrophilic) mercapto-poly(ethylene glycol)
		  (PEG)n-carboxylic acids, respectively, by self-assembling
		  monolayer (SAM) formation. Thereby, a size-independent but
		  ligand-chain length-dependent ligand density was found. The
		  surface coverage increases from 4.3 to 6.3 molecules nm–2
		  with a decrease of ligand chain length from 3.52 to 0.68
		  nm. Furthermore, no significant difference between the
		  surface coverage of hydrophilic and lipophilic ligands with
		  approximately the same ligand length was found, indicating
		  that sterical hindrance is of more importance than, for
		  example, intermolecular strand interactions of Van der
		  Waals forces as claimed in other studies.},

		  understanding of single-molecule kinetics associated with
		  the Michaelis−Menten mechanism of enzymatic reactions.
		  Single-molecule enzymatic turnover experiments typically
		  measure the probability density f(t) of the stochastic
		  waiting time t for individual turnovers. While f(t) can be
		  reconciled with ensemble kinetics, it contains more
		  information than the ensemble data; in particular, it
		  provides crucial information on dynamic disorder, the
		  apparent fluctuation of the catalytic rates due to the
		  interconversion among the enzyme's conformers with
		  different catalytic rate constants. In the presence of
		  dynamic disorder, f(t) exhibits a highly stretched
		  multiexponential decay at high substrate concentrations and
		  a monoexponential decay at low substrate concentrations. We
		  derive a single-molecule Michaelis−Menten equation for
		  the reciprocal of the first moment of f(t), 1/〈t〉,
		  which shows a hyperbolic dependence on the substrate
		  concentration [S], similar to the ensemble enzymatic
		  velocity. We prove that this single-molecule
		  Michaelis−Menten equation holds under many conditions, in
		  particular when the intercoversion rates among different
		  enzyme conformers are slower than the catalytic rate.
		  However, unlike the conventional interpretation, the
		  apparent catalytic rate constant and the apparent Michaelis
		  constant in this single-molecule Michaelis−Menten
		  equation are complicated functions of the catalytic rate
		  constants of individual conformers. We also suggest that
		  the randomness parameter r, defined as 〈(t −
		  〈t〉)2〉/〈t〉2, can serve as an indicator for
		  dynamic disorder in the catalytic step of the enzymatic
		  reaction, as it becomes larger than unity at high substrate
		  concentrations in the presence of dynamic disorder.},

  abstract	= {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool
		  in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has
		  also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in
		  medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date
		  all the fluorescence observables, including spectral
		  shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have
		  all been utilized in basic and applied uses of
		  fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a
		  new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay
		  engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of
		  fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing
		  their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence
		  experiments the radiative rates are not changed because
		  these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the
		  fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by
		  quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental
		  effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in
		  the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or
		  resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the
		  emission by providing additional routes for decay of the
		  excited states without emission. In contrast to the
		  relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is
		  known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing
		  the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic
		  surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from
		  the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of
		  metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or
		  decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of
		  low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes,
		  and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific
		  directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the
		  emitted photons, but rather as the result of the
		  fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the
		  metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal
		  and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the
		  unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative
		  rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical
		  fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can
		  result in an effective increase in photostability.
		  Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the
		  local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict
		  that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near
		  particles can result in usefully high emission from
		  “nonfluorescent” molecules and million-fold increases
		  in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore.
		  We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing
		  and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby
		  metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic
		  quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA
		  detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced
		  fluorescence.},

  abstract	= {Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and
		  complex optical properties. Examples include the intense
		  colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance
		  absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited
		  fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the
		  interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and
		  surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased
		  fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on
		  fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain
		  directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal
		  films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to
		  predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a
		  colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or
		  enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how
		  the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained
		  using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs).
		  The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is
		  simple to understand. According to the RP model, the
		  emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can
		  be predicted from the optical properties of the metal
		  structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory,
		  and/or Maxwell’s equations. For example, according to Mie
		  theory and the size and shape of the particle, the
		  extinction of metal colloids can be due to either
		  absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by
		  absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering.
		  Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench
		  fluorescence because absorption is dominant over
		  scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance
		  fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant
		  over absorption. The ability of a metal’s surface to
		  absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching
		  requirements at the metal–sample interface. Wavenumber
		  matching considerations can also be used to predict whether
		  fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar
		  surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations
		  suggest that the so called “lossy surface waves” which
		  quench fluorescence are due to induced electron
		  oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because
		  wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the
		  energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy
		  surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of
		  the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model
		  provides a rational approach for designing
		  fluorophore–metal configurations with the desired
		  emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic
		  fluorophore technology.},

		  For the purposes of theoretical analysis, we model DNA* as
		  identical to ordinary DNA but supplemented by a
		  longitudinal compression force equal in magnitude but
		  oppositely directed to the stretching (tension) force on
		  DNA caused by phosphate-phosphate repulsions. The null
		  isomer DNA* then becomes an elastically buckled form of
		  fully ionized DNA. On this basis, we derive a nonadditive
		  relationship between the persistence length P of DNA and
		  the persistence length P* of its null isomer. From the
		  formula obtained we can predict the value of P* if P is
		  known, and we can predict the ionic strength dependence of
		  P under the assumption that P* does not depend on ionic
		  strength. We predict a value of P* for null DNA drastically
		  lower than the value of P for DNA in its ordinary state of
		  fully ionized phosphates. The predicted dependence of P on
		  salt concentration is log-c over most of the concentration
		  range, with no tendency toward a salt-independent value in
		  the range of validity of the theory. The predictions are
		  consistent with much of the persistence-length data
		  available for DNA. Alternate theories of the
		  Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman type, including one by the author, are
		  considered skeptically on the grounds that the underlying
		  model may not be realistic. Specifically, we doubt the

		  fluorescence from the organic fluorophores that are
		  embedded in a mesostructured silica shell around individual
		  gold nanorods is enhanced by the longitudinal plasmon

		  show that under an off-resonance excitation, the electric
		  field intensity contour around a nanorod rotates away from
		  the length axis as the excitation polarization is varied.
		  The polarization dependence of the plasmon-enhanced
		  fluorescence is ascribed to the dependence of the averaged
		  electric field intensity enhancement within the silica
		  shell on the excitation polarization. The measured
		  fluorescence enhancement factor is in very good agreement
		  with that obtained from the electrostatic calculations. The
		  fluorescence enhancement factor increases as the
		  longitudinal plasmon wavelength is synthetically tuned
		  close to the excitation wavelength. In addition, the
		  polarization dependence is used to determine the
		  orientation angle of the gold nanorods. The results are in
		  excellent agreement with the actual measurements.
		  Furthermore, the emission spectrum of the fluorophore is
		  modified by the longitudinal plasmon resonance of the gold
		  nanorods. A linear correlation between the emission peak
		  wavelength and the longitudinal plasmon wavelength is
		  obtained.},

  abstract	= {In most electronic imaging applications, images with high
		  resolution (HR) are desired and often required. HR means
		  that pixel density within an image is high, and therefore
		  an HR image can offer more details that may be critical in
		  various applications. For example, HR medical images are
		  very helpful for a doctor to make a correct diagnosis. It
		  may be easy to distinguish an object from similar ones
		  using HR satellite images, and the performance of pattern
		  recognition in computer vision can be improved if an HR
		  image is provided. Since the 1970s, charge-coupled device
		  (CCD) and CMOS image sensors have been widely used to
		  capture digital images. Although these sensors are suitable
		  for most imaging applications, the current resolution level
		  and consumer price will not satisfy the future demand. For
		  example, people want an inexpensive HR digital
		  camera/camcorder or see the price gradually reduce, and
		  scientists often need a very HR level close to that of an
		  analog 35 mm film that has no visible artifacts when an
		  image is magnified. Thus, finding a way to increase the
		  current resolution level is needed.},

		  imaged by means of far-field fluorescence. At suitable
		  levels of dilution, on optically transparent electrode
		  surfaces, reversible interfacial electron transfer
		  processes can be followed pixel by pixel down to scales
		  which approach the molecular. In mapping out switching
		  potentials across a surface population, thermodynamic
		  dispersion, related to variance in the orientation,
		  electronic coupling, protein fold, electric field drop, and
		  general surface order, can be quantified. The
		  self-assembled monolayer buffering the protein from the
		  underlying metallic electrode surface not only acts to tune
		  electronic coupling between the two but also potentially
		  provides a variable more easily segmented from other
		  contributions to molecular dispersion. We have,
		  specifically, considered the possibility that the
		  supporting monolayer crystallinity is a significant
		  contributor to the subsequently observed spread in
		  half-wave potentials. We report here that this is indeed
		  the case and that this spread diminishes from 17 to 12 mV
		  for the blue copper protein azurin as the supporting
		  alkanethiol layer crystallinity increases. The work herein,
		  then, presents not only a direct determination of
		  submonolayer scale variance in redox character but also a
		  means of tuning this through gross surface and entirely
		  standard chemical means.},

  abstract	= {Zero mode waveguides (ZMWs), subwavelength optical
		  nanostructures with dimensions ranging from 50 to 200 nm,
		  have been used to study systems involving ligand-receptor
		  interactions. We show that under proper conditions, lipid
		  membranes will invaginate into the nanostructures, which
		  confine optical excitation to subattoliter volumes.
		  Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to
		  characterize the diffusion of fluorescently tagged lipids
		  in liquid-disordered phase
		  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and
		  gel phase 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)
		  membranes incubated on the nanostructured surface. In
		  contrast to the POPC, DSPC membranes did not appear to
		  enter the structures, suggesting that invagination is
		  dependent on membrane rigidity. Although correlation curves
		  obtained from POPC membranes conformed to previously
		  derived models for diffusion in the evanescent field within
		  the nanostructure, the diffusion constants obtained were
		  systematically lower than expected. The validity of the
		  one-dimensional diffusion model for membrane diffusion is
		  discussed and it is concluded that the erroneous diffusion
		  constants are a result of nontrivial membrane conformation
		  within the ZMWs. Additionally, FCS was used to characterize
		  the fraction of fluorescently labeled tetanus toxin C
		  fragment bound to a ganglioside-populated POPC membrane
		  within the ZMWs. This allowed the determination of the
		  toxin's equilibrium binding constant at a concentration of
		  500 nM; higher than possible with diffraction-limited FCS.
		  To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first
		  reported for supported lipid bilayers in nanostructured
		  devices. Furthermore, they open the possibility of studying
		  membrane imbedded receptors and proteins at physiological
		  concentrations with single-molecule resolution.},

		  easy-to-implement approach to localization-based
		  super-resolution microscopy, owing to the use of DNA
		  probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short
		  dye-labeled ('imager') oligonucleotides to their
		  complementary target ('docking') strands creates the
		  necessary 'blinking' to enable stochastic super-resolution

		  that individual components can be chosen and implemented

		  Interpretations of the fluorescence responses obtained are

		  the use of quartz fiber-optic waveguides to convert the
		  right-angle cuvette geometry of the analytical
		  spectrofluorophotometer to an open-ended fluorescence probe
		  geometry, resulting in a flexible culture fluorescence
		  apparatus. Features of the apparatus include variable

		  which the fluorescent molecules are contained. In this
		  work, FCS is used to monitor the dynamics of fluorescence
		  emission from Cy5 labeled on DNA probes. We found that the
		  FBKs of Cy5 can be tuned by having more or less unpaired
		  guanines (upG) and thymines (upT) around the Cy5 dye. The

		  which the FBKs play a major role rather than the diffusion
		  kinetics. We further show that the alterations of the FBKs
		  of Cy5 on probe hybridization can be used to differentiate
		  DNA targets with single-nucleotide differences. This
		  discrimination relies on the design of a probe-target-probe
		  DNA three-way-junction, whose basepairing configuration can
