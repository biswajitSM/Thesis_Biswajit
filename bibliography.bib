      constants and diffusion coefficients by measuring the rates
      of decay of spontaneous concentration fluctuations. The
      equilibrium of the system is not disturbed during the
      measurement. We measure the number of molecules of a
      specified type in a defined open volume as a function of
      time and compute the time course of the deviations from the
      thermodynamic mean concentration. The method is based on
      the principle that the rates of decay of spontaneous
      microscopic fluctuations are determined by the same
      phenomenological rate coefficients as those of macroscopic
      departures from equilibrium which result from external
      perturbations. Hence, an analysis of fluctuations yields
      the same chemical rate constants and diffusion coefficients
      as are measured by conventional procedures. In practice the
      number of the specified molecules is measured by a property
      such as absorbance or fluorescence which is specific and
      sensitive to chemical change. The sample volume is defined
      by a light beam which traverses the cell. As the molecules
      appear in or disappear from the light beam, either due to
      diffusion or chemical reaction, their concentration
      fluctuations give rise to corresponding fluctuations of the
      intensity of absorbed or emitted light. This paper presents
      the theory needed to derive chemical rate constants and
      diffusion coefficients from these fluctuations in light
      intensity. The theory is applied to three examples of
      general interest: pure diffusion in the absence of chemical
      reaction; the binding of a small rapidly diffusing ligand
      to a larger slowly diffusing macromolecule; and a
      unimolecular isomerization. The method should be especially
      useful in studying highly cooperative systems, relatively
      noncooperative systems with intermediate states closely
      spaced in free energy, small systems, and systems not
      readily subject to perturbations of state.},

      steady-state φFs, divided by φFm, can be used routinely
      to estimate changes in the quantum yield of non-cyclic

      efficiency of excitation capture by these centres will
      determine the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron

      separated from holo-azurin with a spectral ratio of 0.58

      electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE and IEF) and spectroscopic
      (UV/vis, 1H-NMR, static and dynamic fluorescence)
      techniques, and compared to the properties of holo-azurin

      values of His-35 and His-117, same fluorescence
      characteristics). However, it has lost the ability to bind
      Cu-ions. It is tentatively concluded that azurin* is a
      chemically modified form of azurin, the modification
      possibly being due to oxidation of the ligand residue
      Cys-112 or the formation of a chemical bond between the
      ligand residues Cys-112 and His-117. In agreement with
      previous results from Hutnik and Szabo (Biochemistry (1989)

      heterogeneous fluorescence decay observed for holo-azurin
      is not due to the presence of azurin*, but most likely
      originates from conformational heterogeneity of the
      holo-azurin.},

      which the image contrast is derived from the fluorescence
      lifetime at each point in a two-dimensional image and not
      the local concentration and/or intensity of the
      fluorophore. In the present apparatus, lifetime images are
      created from a series of images obtained with a
      gain-modulated image intensifier. The frequency of gain
      modulation is at the light-modulation frequency (or a
      harmonic thereof), resulting in homodyne phase-sensitive
      images. These stationary phase-sensitive images are
      collected using a slow-scan CCD camera. A series of such
      images, obtained with various phase shifts of the
      gain-modulation signal, is used to determine the phase
      angle and/or modulation of the emission at each pixel,
      which is in essence the phase or modulation lifetime image.
      An advantage of this method is that pixel-to-pixel scanning
      is not required to obtain the images, as the information
      from all pixels is obtained at the same time. The method
      has been experimentally verified by creating lifetime
      images of standard fluorophores with known lifetimes,
      ranging from 1 to 10 ns. As an example of biochemical
      imaging we created lifetime images of Yt-base when quenched
      by acrylamide, as a model for a fluorophore in distinct
      environments that affect its decay time. Additionally, we
      describe a faster imaging procedure that allows images in
      which a specific decay time is suppressed to be calculated,
      allowing rapid visualization of unique features and/or
      regions with distinct decay times. The concepts and
      methodologies of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) have
      numerous potential applications in the biosciences.
      Fluorescence lifetimes are known to be sensitive to
      numerous chemical and physical factors such as pH, oxygen,
      temperature, cations, polarity, and binding to
      macromolecules. Hence the FLIM method allows chemical or
      physical imaging of macroscopic and microscopic samples.},

      This work has shown that protein reorganization energies
      are sensitive to the medium surrounding the redox sites and
      that an aqueous environment, in particular, leads to large
      reorganization energies. Analyses of electronic-coupling
      strengths suggest that the efficiency of long-range ET

  abstract  = {Fluorescence spectroscopy is a widely used research tool
      in biochemistry and molecular biology. Fluorescence has
      also become the dominant method enabling the revolution in
      medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and genomics. To date
      all the fluorescence observables, including spectral
      shifts, anisotropies, quantum yields, and lifetimes, have
      all been utilized in basic and applied uses of
      fluorescence. In this forward-looking article we describe a
      new opportunity in fluorescence, radiative decay
      engineering (RDE). By RDE we mean modifying the emission of
      fluorophores or chromophores by increasing or decreasing
      their radiative decay rates. In most fluorescence
      experiments the radiative rates are not changed because
      these rates depend on the extinction coefficient of the
      fluorophore. This intrinsic rate is not changed by
      quenching and is only weakly dependent on environmental
      effects. Spectral changes are usually caused by changes in
      the nonradiative rates resulting from quenching or
      resonance energy transfer. These processes affect the
      emission by providing additional routes for decay of the
      excited states without emission. In contrast to the
      relatively constant radiative rates in free solution, it is
      known that the radiative rates can be modified by placing
      the fluorophores at suitable distances from metallic
      surfaces and particles. This Review summarizes results from
      the physics literature which demonstrate the effects of
      metallic surfaces, colloids, or islands on increasing or
      decreasing emissive rates, increasing the quantum yields of
      low quantum yield chromophores, decreasing the lifetimes,
      and directing the typically isotropic emission in specific
      directions. These effects are not due to reflection of the
      emitted photons, but rather as the result of the
      fluorophore dipole interacting with free electrons in the
      metal. These interactions change the intensity and temporal
      and spatial distribution of the radiation. We describe the
      unusual effects expected from increases in the radiative
      rates with reference to intrinsic and extrinsic biochemical
      fluorophores. For instance, the decreased lifetime can
      result in an effective increase in photostability.
      Proximity to nearby metallic surfaces can also increase the
      local field and modify the rate of excitation. We predict
      that the appropriate localization of fluorophores near
      particles can result in usefully high emission from
      “nonfluorescent” molecules and million-fold increases
      in the number of photons observable from each fluorophore.
      We also describe how RDE can be applied to medical testing
      and biotechnology. As one example we predict that nearby
      metal surfaces can be used to increase the low intrinsic
      quantum yields of nucleic acids and make unlabeled DNA
      detectable using its intrinsic metal-enhanced
      fluorescence.},

      from 5 to 200ms. The results show that the diffusion of
      30–40% of the molecules is constrained in domains with a

  abstract  = {This paper summarizes our present theoretical
      understanding of single-molecule kinetics associated with
      the Michaelis−Menten mechanism of enzymatic reactions.
      Single-molecule enzymatic turnover experiments typically
      measure the probability density f(t) of the stochastic
      waiting time t for individual turnovers. While f(t) can be
      reconciled with ensemble kinetics, it contains more
      information than the ensemble data; in particular, it
      provides crucial information on dynamic disorder, the
      apparent fluctuation of the catalytic rates due to the
      interconversion among the enzyme's conformers with
      different catalytic rate constants. In the presence of
      dynamic disorder, f(t) exhibits a highly stretched
      multiexponential decay at high substrate concentrations and
      a monoexponential decay at low substrate concentrations. We
      derive a single-molecule Michaelis−Menten equation for
      the reciprocal of the first moment of f(t), 1/〈t〉,
      which shows a hyperbolic dependence on the substrate
      concentration [S], similar to the ensemble enzymatic
      velocity. We prove that this single-molecule
      Michaelis−Menten equation holds under many conditions, in
      particular when the intercoversion rates among different
      enzyme conformers are slower than the catalytic rate.
      However, unlike the conventional interpretation, the
      apparent catalytic rate constant and the apparent Michaelis
      constant in this single-molecule Michaelis−Menten
      equation are complicated functions of the catalytic rate
      constants of individual conformers. We also suggest that
      the randomness parameter r, defined as 〈(t −
      〈t〉)2〉/〈t〉2, can serve as an indicator for
      dynamic disorder in the catalytic step of the enzymatic
      reaction, as it becomes larger than unity at high substrate
      concentrations in the presence of dynamic disorder.},

  abstract  = {Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and
      complex optical properties. Examples include the intense
      colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance
      absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited
      fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the
      interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and
      surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased
      fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on
      fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain
      directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal
      films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to
      predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a
      colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or
      enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how
      the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained
      using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs).
      The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is
      simple to understand. According to the RP model, the
      emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can
      be predicted from the optical properties of the metal
      structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory,
      and/or Maxwell’s equations. For example, according to Mie
      theory and the size and shape of the particle, the
      extinction of metal colloids can be due to either
      absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by
      absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering.
      Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench
      fluorescence because absorption is dominant over
      scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance
      fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant
      over absorption. The ability of a metal’s surface to
      absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching
      requirements at the metal–sample interface. Wavenumber
      matching considerations can also be used to predict whether
      fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar
      surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations
      suggest that the so called “lossy surface waves” which
      quench fluorescence are due to induced electron
      oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because
      wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the
      energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy
      surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of
      the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model
      provides a rational approach for designing
      fluorophore–metal configurations with the desired
      emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic
      fluorophore technology.},

  abstract  = {To understand better the effect of electrostatics on the
      rigidity of the DNA double helix, we define DNA*, the null
      isomer of DNA, as the hypothetical structure that would
      result from DNA if its phosphate groups were not ionized.
      For the purposes of theoretical analysis, we model DNA* as
      identical to ordinary DNA but supplemented by a
      longitudinal compression force equal in magnitude but
      oppositely directed to the stretching (tension) force on
      DNA caused by phosphate-phosphate repulsions. The null
      isomer DNA* then becomes an elastically buckled form of
      fully ionized DNA. On this basis, we derive a nonadditive
      relationship between the persistence length P of DNA and
      the persistence length P* of its null isomer. From the
      formula obtained we can predict the value of P* if P is
      known, and we can predict the ionic strength dependence of
      P under the assumption that P* does not depend on ionic
      strength. We predict a value of P* for null DNA drastically
      lower than the value of P for DNA in its ordinary state of
      fully ionized phosphates. The predicted dependence of P on
      salt concentration is log-c over most of the concentration
      range, with no tendency toward a salt-independent value in
      the range of validity of the theory. The predictions are
      consistent with much of the persistence-length data
      available for DNA. Alternate theories of the
      Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman type, including one by the author, are
      considered skeptically on the grounds that the underlying
      model may not be realistic. Specifically, we doubt the
      accuracy for real polyelectrolytes of the
      Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman assumption that the polymer structure
      is invariant to changes in electrostatic forces.},

      the intrinsic fast-blinking kinetics (FBKs) of fluorescent
      molecules that occur on the order of microseconds. These
      FBKs can be heavily influenced by the microenvironments in
      which the fluorescent molecules are contained. In this
      work, FCS is used to monitor the dynamics of fluorescence
      emission from Cy5 labeled on DNA probes. We found that the
      FBKs of Cy5 can be tuned by having more or less unpaired
      guanines (upG) and thymines (upT) around the Cy5 dye. The
      observed FBKs of Cy5 are found to predominantly originate
      from the isomerization and back-isomerization processes of
      Cy5, and Cy5-nucleobase interactions are shown to slow down
      these processes. These findings lead to a more precise
      quantification of DNA hybridization using FCS analysis, in
      which the FBKs play a major role rather than the diffusion
      kinetics. We further show that the alterations of the FBKs
      of Cy5 on probe hybridization can be used to differentiate
      DNA targets with single-nucleotide differences. This
      discrimination relies on the design of a probe-target-probe
      DNA three-way-junction, whose basepairing configuration can
      be altered as a consequence of a single-nucleotide
      substitution on the target. Reconfiguration of the
      three-way-junction alters the Cy5-upG or Cy5-upT
      interactions, therefore resulting in a measurable change in
      Cy5 FBKs. Detection of single-nucleotide variations within
      a sequence selected from the Kras gene is carried out to
      validate the concept of this new method.},

      have aided the advancement of single-molecule and

      mechanism of the action of antifading agents such as Trolox
      is still missing. In this communication we present evidence
      that Trolox acts in accordance with a mechanism that
      involves triplet quenching through electron transfer and
      subsequent recovery of the resulting radical ion by the
      complementary redox reaction. The required oxidant for this
      unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system
      (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular
      oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a
      quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing
      properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting
      results regarding the action of antifading agents and might
      lead to a common mechanistic understanding of
      photobleaching and its prevention. Finally, a recipe on the
      proper use of Trolox as an antifading agent is provided.},

      objects such as single molecules, it is important to be
      able to control light–molecule interactions1, 2, 3, 4.
      Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields
      when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman
      scattering5, but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs
      depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal
      tips6 and colloids7, 8 can enhance fluorescence, the highly
      enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated
      bowtie nanoantennas9 provide a structure that is more
      controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold
      bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's
      fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than
      reported previously7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
      18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that
      this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an
      increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement
      of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor
      of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects.
      Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for
      high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.},

      surfaces, reversible interfacial electron transfer

      carriers in numerous applications owing to their low-cost
      and size-controlled preparation as well as their
      straightforward surface functionalization with thiol
      containing molecules forming self-assembling monolayers
      (SAM). The quantification of the ligand density of such
      modified GNPs is technically challenging, yet of utmost
      importance for quality control in many applications. In
      this contribution, a new method for the determination of
      the surface coverage of GNPs with thiol containing ligands
      is proposed. It makes use of the measurement of the
      gold-to-sulfur (Au/S) ratio by inductively coupled plasma
      mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) and its dependence on the
      nanoparticle diameter. The simultaneous ICP–MS
      measurement of gold and sulfur was carefully validated and
      found to be a robust method with a relative standard
      uncertainty of lower than 10%. A major advantage of this
      method is the independence from sample preparation; for
      example, sample loss during the washing steps is not
      affecting the results. To demonstrate the utility of the
      straightforward method, GNPs of different diameters were
      synthesized and derivatized on the surface with
      bifunctional (lipophilic) ω-mercapto-alkanoic acids and
      (hydrophilic) mercapto-poly(ethylene glycol)
      (PEG)n-carboxylic acids, respectively, by self-assembling
      monolayer (SAM) formation. Thereby, a size-independent but
      ligand-chain length-dependent ligand density was found. The
      surface coverage increases from 4.3 to 6.3 molecules nm–2
      with a decrease of ligand chain length from 3.52 to 0.68
      nm. Furthermore, no significant difference between the
      surface coverage of hydrophilic and lipophilic ligands with
      approximately the same ligand length was found, indicating
      that sterical hindrance is of more importance than, for
      example, intermolecular strand interactions of Van der
      Waals forces as claimed in other studies.},

      reduced forms of both pyridine nucleotides are fluorescent
      in living cells but they cannot be distinguished, as they

      enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its
      SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement
      results from both an excitation rate enhancement of
      &#x223C;130 and an effective emission enhancement of
      &#x223C;9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases
      sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the

      partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the

      distances on sub-10 nm scale. Extending the range and
      applicability of FRET requires enhancement of the
      fluorescence energy transfer at a spatial scale comparable
      to the donor-acceptor distances. Plasmonic nanoantennas are
      ideal to concentrate optical fields at a nanoscale fully
      matching the FRET distance range. Here, we present a
      resonant aluminum nanogap antenna tailored to enhance
      single molecule FRET. A 20 nm gap confines light into a
      nanoscale volume, providing a field gradient on the scale
      of the donor-acceptor distance, a large 10-fold increase in
      the local density of optical states, and strong intensity
      enhancement. With our dedicated design, we obtain 20-fold
      enhancement on the fluorescence emission of donor and
      acceptor dyes, and most importantly up to 5-fold
      enhancement of the FRET rate for donor-acceptor separations
      of 10 nm. We also provide a thorough framework of the
      fluorescence photophysics occurring in the nanoscale gap

      various advantages of optical nanoantennas and provides a

      down to (20 &#xB1; 10) nm. To validate their applicability
      on live cell research, we used the antenna substrates as
      hotspots of localized illumination to excite fluorescently
      labeled lipids on living cell membranes. The high
      signal-to-background afforded by the BNA arrays allowed the
      recording of single fluorescent bursts corresponding to the
      passage of freely diffusing individual lipids through
      hotspot excitation regions as small as 20 nm. Statistical
      analysis of burst length and intensity together with
      simulations demonstrate that the measured signals arise
      from the ultraconfined excitation region of the antennas.
      Because these inexpensive antenna arrays are fully
      biocompatible and amenable to their integration in most
      fluorescence microscopes, we foresee a large number of

      While there have been multiple demonstrations of NIR

      how light-triggered release works in such complexes is
      still limited. Here, we investigate the specific mechanisms

      that the characteristics of nanoparticle-based DNA release
      vary profoundly from the same nanoparticle complex,
      depending on the type of laser excitation. CW laser
      illumination drives the photothermal release of
      dehybridized single-stranded DNA, while pulsed-laser
      excitation results in double-stranded DNA release by
      cleavage of the Au–S bond, with negligible local heating.

  abstract  = {We propose two-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
      (2fFCS) on basis of plasmonic nanoantennas that provide
      distinct hot spots that are individually addressable
      through polarization, yet lie within a single diffraction
      limited microscope focus. The importance of two-focus FCS
      is that a calibrated distance between foci provides an
      intrinsic calibration to derive diffusion constants from
      measured correlation times. Through electromagnetic
      modelling we analyze a geometry of perpendicular nanorods,
      and their inverse, i.e., nanoslits. While we find that
      nanorods are not suited for nano-antenna enhanced 2fFCS due
      to substantial background signal, a nanoslit geometry is
      expected to provide a di tinct cross-correlation between
      orthogonally polarized detection channels. Furthermore, by
      utilizing a periodic array of nanoslits instead of a single
      pair, the amplitude of the cross-correlation can be
      enhanced. To demonstrate this technique, we present a proof
      of principle experiment on the basis of a periodic array of
      nanoslits, applied to lipid diffusion in a supported lipid
      bilayer.}

      enhance the radiative decay rates of monoexcitons and
      biexcitons by 109 and 100 folds at quantum efficiencies of
      60 and 70%, respectively, in very good agreement with the
      outcome of numerical calculations. We discuss the

  abstract  = {Super-resolution techniques have begun to transform
      biological and biomedical research by allowing researchers
      to observe structures well below the classic diffraction
      limit of light. DNA points accumulation for imaging in
      nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) offers an
      easy-to-implement approach to localization-based
      super-resolution microscopy, owing to the use of DNA
      probes. In DNA-PAINT, transient binding of short
      dye-labeled ('imager') oligonucleotides to their
      complementary target ('docking') strands creates the
      necessary 'blinking' to enable stochastic super-resolution
      microscopy. Using the programmability and specificity of
      DNA molecules as imaging and labeling probes allows
      researchers to decouple blinking from dye photophysics,
      alleviating limitations of current super-resolution
      techniques, making them compatible with virtually any
      single-molecule-compatible dye. Recent developments in
      DNA-PAINT have enabled spectrally unlimited multiplexing,
      precise molecule counting and ultra-high, molecular-scale
      (sub-5-nm) spatial resolution, reaching ~1-nm localization
      precision. DNA-PAINT can be applied to a multitude of in
      vitro and cellular applications by linking docking strands
      to antibodies. Here, we present a protocol for the key
      aspects of the DNA-PAINT framework for both novice and
      expert users. This protocol describes the creation of DNA
      origami test samples, in situ sample preparation,
      multiplexed data acquisition, data simulation,
      super-resolution image reconstruction and post-processing
      such as drift correction, molecule counting (qPAINT) and
      particle averaging. Moreover, we provide an integrated
      software package, named Picasso, for the computational
      steps involved. The protocol is designed to be modular, so
      that individual components can be chosen and implemented
      per requirements of a specific application. The procedure
      can be completed in 1–2 d.},
